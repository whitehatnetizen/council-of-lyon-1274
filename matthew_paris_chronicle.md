PREFACE. Thb name of Matthew Paris is too well known to the public to \' render any apology necessary for publishing an Engliish translation of his valuable \'\' English History,\" --- a work\' wherein its author has condensed all that former writers had said about the times that preceded, and to which all succeeding writers must have recourse for the histovy of the period in which\' its author lived. Of the life\^ of this laborious writer, very little is known. He was a monk of St. Alban\'s Abbey, and was. probably called Fcmaiemis, the \"Parisian,\" which we generaUy interpret \"Paris,\" from having been bom or educaibed in the capital of France; Unlike most of the monks of the Middle Ages, ifdio seldom were content to pass through life without bequeathing to posterity a weighty load of theological works, and commentaries on the Bible, Matthew Paris -scenes to have confined his attention wholly to the study of history, and, with a laudable patriotism, to the history of his own country. To this circumstance may be ascribed the pains which he took, even after his great work was completed, to improve it in every way, and to gather fresh stores tram every available source. His writings may be thus enumerated : --- 1. He compiled a work called Historia Majors extending down to the year of Christ 1273 ; the former part of which.

VI PBBPACE. previous to the year 1235, has been lately ascertained to be Roger of Wendover\'s Flowers of History, with numerous additions by Matthew Paris, --- \^not, however, so numerous as to entitle the compiler to claim the work, which he had appropriated, as his own. This was fer from the intention of Matthew Paris and his copyists ; for, in the margin of one of the early manuscript copies now remaining, at the year 1235, we read : \'\^ So £u\* is copied from an old book ;\" and in another old manuscript of the same work are found the words, \" Mister Soger of Wendover, formerly prior of Belvoir, has thus far digested his chronicles.\" The early part of Matthew Paris\'s work is now generally ascribed to its real author, and, as such, has been already translated and published in the present series. The work now offered to the public, begins at the year 1235, where Soger of Wendover\'s work leaves o% and extends to its termination in 1273, about which time, probably, its writer departed this life. 2. A second work of Matthew Paris, supplementary to the former, contained, Lwes of the two Ojffas, kings of Mercia, and of twenty-three ahbcUs of St AlbwrCs, together with AdditcmvenUby or additions to the Historia Major, and Augtarivm Additamentormn, or supplementary additions to the same. These additions stand somewhat in the light of notes to the original work\* 3. The last work of Matthew Paris is his Historia Minor, a sort of abridgment of the greater work, and embodying a condensation of all his historical collections, with the exception of the lives of the OfEas and the abbats of St. Alban\'s. The Historia Minor is the only one of these three works

This warning they set at naught, with laughter and ridicule, and even tlieats ; whereupon the bishop, arming himself with the weapons of spiritual justice, launched a general anathema against all of them, and briefly and decidedly ordered them to depart at once out of the city of London, which had until then been free from such a pest, that his diocese might not be tainted with such a stain. But they, swelling with pride, and trusting in the pope\'s protection, without difficulty or loss of time, obtained at the court of Bome that the said bishop, who was now old, weak, and ill, should be cited peremptonly to distant parts beyond the sea, before judges who were friends of the Caursines, and chosen at their option, that so he should appear and answer for tin-wrong done to the pope\'s merchants. But the bishop choosing, like Shem, to cover his father\'s nakedness rather \^l-than, with Ham, to expose it, put a peacefiil end to the tumult that had been raised, and dissembling what had happened, committed his cause to the patronage of St. Paul, who, when he preached of the rigour and faith of justice, wrote thus : \" Though an angel shall preach to you the contrary of these things, let him be accursed.\"\* The insolence qf the Minorite Brethren, At this time some of the Minorite brethren, as well as some of the order of Preachers, unmindful of their profession y and the restrictions of their order, impudently entered the territories of some noble monasteries, under pretence of fulfilling their duties of preaching, as if intending to depart after preaching the next day. Under pretence of sickness or on some other pretext, however, they remained, and, constructing an altar of wood, they placed on it a consecrated stone altar, which they had brought with them, and clan\* destinely and in a low voice performed mass, and even received the confessions of many of the parishioners, to the \* Gal. i. 8.

And they said that they had obtained authority from the pope to receive from those of the £Eiith the confessions which they were ashamed to make to their own priests, or scorned to make, because the priests had committed the same offence, or were a&aid to do so because the priest was drunk ; and to such they, the Minorites, gave adsolution after having enjoined penance on them. In the mean time they sent a proctor to the Boman court with all pHeed, to plead their cause against the religious men, in whose territory they were staying, and obtained permission to remain there with some other benefit in addition. And if by chance they were not satisfied with this, they broke forth in insults and threats, reviling every order except their own, and asserting that all the rest were amongst those doomed to damnation, and that they would not spare the soles of their feet till they had exhausted the wealth of their opposers\^ however great it might be. The religious men therefore gave way to them in many points, yielding to avoid scandal and offending those in power. For they were the counsellors and messengers of the nobles, and even secretaries of the pope\^ and therefore obtained much secular favour. Some, however, finding themselves opposed at the court of Rome, were restrained by obvious reasons, and went away in concision ; for the supreme pontiff with a scowling look said to them, \" What means this, my brethren 1 to what lengths are you going \] have you not professed voluntary poverty, and that you would traverse towns and castles and distant places, as the case required, barefooted and unostentatiously, in order to preach the word of God in all humility ? and do you now presume to usurp these estates to yourselves against the will of the lords of these fees ? Your religion appears to be in a great measure dying away, and your doctrines to be confuted.\" On hearing this they went away and began to conduct themselves more moderately, though they had formerly talked so boastingly, and refused to be guided by the will of others, although they were in houses not their own. In this year Cordova, a well-known city of Spain, was taken by the king of Castile, after slajdng the brother of the Emir of the world,\* and cutting his army to pieces. \* The king of Africa enjoyed this magnificent title.

In the same year, at the advent of our Lord, Eobert Fitz-Walter, a baron of illustrious race, and renowned in feats of arms, went the way of all flesh ; and in the same year, too, in the flower of his youth, Roger de Sumerie was taken away from amongst men, a man of singular elegance, respectable race, and of remarkable prowess. In this year, too, as a token of the continuation of his regard, the emperor sent a camel to the king. Kinff Henry marries Eleanor, daughter of the count of Provence. Anno Domini 1236, which was the twentieth year of the reign of King Henry the Third, he held his court at Winchester at Christmas, where he observed that festival with rejoicings. He was at this time anxiously looking for the return of the special messengers, whom he had sent into Provence to Raymond, count of that province, with letters containing his own inmost thoughts about contracting a marriage with his daughter Eleanor. This said count was a man of illustrious race and brave in battle, but, by continual wars, he had wasted almost all the money he possessed. He had married the daughter of Thomas, the late coimt of Savoy, and sister of the present count, Amadeus, a woman of remarkable beauty, by name Beatrice. This lady had issue by the aforesaid count, two daughters of great beauty, the elder of whom, named Margaret, was married to Louis, the French king, as we are told by a clerk named John de Grates ; and the king of England had now, by the aforesaid messengers, demanded the younger one, a young lady of handsome appearance, in marriage. In order to obtain this favour, he hiad secretly sent Richard, prior of Hurle, in advance, who faithfully and with diligence brought the matter to a conclusion. On the prior\'s returning and telling the king the result, the latter sent him back to the count with some other messengers, namely, the bishops Hugh of Ely, and Robert of Hereford, and the brother of Robert de Sandford, the master of the Knights Templars. These messengers were received by the count on their arrival in Provence with the greatest honour and respect, and from his hands received his daughter Eleanor, for the purpose of being united to the king of England ; she was also attended by her uncle, William, biSiop

The king of Navarre, on learning that they would travel through his territories, went joyftdly to meet them, and accompanied them as a guide through his dominions during a journey of five days and more ; he also, from his natural generosity, paid all their expenses, both for horses and attendants. Their retinue consisted of more than three himdred horsemen, not including the people who followed them in great numbers. On reaching the boimdaries of Prance, they obtained not only a safe but honourable passage through that country, under conduct of the French king and his queen, the sister of the lady about to be married to the English king, and also of Blanche, the French king\'s mother. They embarked at the port of Sandwich, \* and with ftill sail made for Dover, where they arrived, after a quick passage, before they were expected. Having thus safely landed, they set out for Canterbury, and were met by the king, who rushed into the arms of the messengers, and, having seen the lady and received possession of her, he married her at Canterbury ; the ceremony being performed on the fourteenth oi January, by Edmund, archbishop of that place, assisted by the bishops, who had come with the lady, in the presence of the other nobles and prelates of the kingdom. On the 19th of January the king went to Westminster, where an extraordinary solemnity took place on the foUowing day, which was Sunday, at which the king wore his crown and Eleanor was crowned queen. Thus was Henry the Third married at Canterbury, and the nuptials were celebrated in London, at Westminster, on the feast of St. Fabian and St. Sebastian.

The justiciary of the forests arranged the drinking cups on the table at the king\'s right hand, although he met with some opposition, which however fell to the ground. The citizens of Lond5n passed the wine about in all directions, in costly cups, and those of Winchester superintended the cooking of the feast ; the rest, according to the ancient statutes, filled their separate stations\^ or made their claims to do so. And in order that the nuptial festivities might not be clouded by any disputes, saving the right of any one, many things were put up with for tke time which they left for decision at a more fe,vourable opportimity. The office of chancellor of England, and all the offices connected with the king, are ordaJAed and assized in the Exchequer.

Also, all widows shall henceforth be at liberty to bequeath all the com on their land, as well from their dowries, as from other lands and tenements, saving the services which are due to their lords from their dowries and other tenements. Also, whoever shall have been disseised from his free tenement, and shall have recovered possession by assize of a new disseisin before the justiciaries, or shall have made a disseisin with their cognizance, and when disseised shall have held possession through the sheriff, if the said disseisers shall have disseised them after the circuit of the justiciaries or during the same, and shall be convicted thereof, they shall be taken and detained in a prison of our lord the king, until by him they are liberated, either by ransom or in any other manner.

A writing sent to the pope concerning the origin and laws of Mahomet. About the same time, a letter was sent to his holiness, Pope Gregory the Ninth, from the countries of the East, by the preachers who were travelling in those parts. And when it was published to the world, the false doctrine, yea, the madness of Mahomet, the prophet of the Saracens, an account of whom was given therein, excited the derision and mockery of all. But these things have been previously treated of in their proper place, namely, in the ye\^ar DC, when the Mahomedan plague commenced. The Saracens perversely think that they are so called from Sarah ; but they are with greater truth called Agarenes from Agar, and Ismaelites from Ismael, whom Abraham begat by Agar his servant ; and from Ismael were begotten in succession, Calcar, Neptis, Alumesca, Eldamo, Mulier, Escicip, laman, Avicait, Atanan, Maath, Nizas, Mildar, Hinclas, Materic, Humella, Karmana, Melikar, Feir, Galib, Luhei, Muyra, Heelib, Cuztei, and Abdimelnef, who had two sons, Escim and Abdicemuz ; Escim, one of these two, begat Adelmudalib ; Adelmudalib begat Abdella, from whom sprung Maumath, who is considered the prophet of the Saracens ; and from him were begotten successively Abdicemuz, Humenla, Abilaz, Accan, Morcan, Abdelmelibe, Maviaj Abderachaman (by some called Abdimenef ) ; and from him sprung Mahomet, who is now worshipped and reverenced by the Saracens, as their chief prophet.

Clf the practices in which Mahomet was brought up. This man, called Mahomet the Ismaelite, on the death of his father, Abdimenef, was taken charge of by a man named Hebenabecalip, who acted as his guardian, and brought him up; a man who attended to the idols at a place called Oalingua, and abo Aliguze. When he arrived at the age of youth, he became a hireling to a certain woman named Adige, the daughter of Hulaith, who gave him an ass for his service, to bring goods into the provinces of Asia, for which she was to \^•eceive the value. At length, he secretly cohabited with this woman, and married her, and grew very rich by her money. He became greatly elated at this, and began to boast, and endeavoured to establish himself as ruler over all the tribes and his own nation ; indeed, he would have presumed so far as to call himself their king, if some more noble and stronger than himself had not opposed this usurpation. He then declared that he was a prophet sent fix)m God, and that . all people ought to believe his words. The ignorant Arab y rustics, who had never seen a prophet, believedhim ; there was also a certain apostate there who had fallen into heresy, and was excommunicated, and he taught the same creed, and wrote his doctrines. This said Machometh enticed into friendship with him any freebooters and robbers that he could collect, and placed them in secret out-of-the-way places, for the purpose of robbing the merchants on their way to and from Asia. One day, as he was coming from the cities (rf Jerveth and Matham, he found on the road a camel belonging to a man named Abige Heli, the son of Hyesem, which he immediately seized and fled to the city of Macta ; but the inhabitants of that place, not considering him a pro\* phet, insulted him, and expelled him from the city as an impostor, detesting him as a robber and despoiler of travellers. He then went to a city in the desert, where the inhabitants were partly Jews and partly Pagans, idolaters, poor, and ignorant men ; there he with his followers built a temple, in \* Chosroes in Roman history.

After this he sent a follower of his, named Gadimelic, with forty soldiers, to rob the merchants who were trayellin£ with large sains of money. These men were met by Ab\^ Hely, the son of Jesem (whose camel Mahomet had carried off), attended by three hundred men of his city, and at sight of these, the robbers sent by Mahomet took to flight, and that pseudo-prophet could not foresee this event to guard against it, for he had not the spirit of prophecy ; the Saracens therefore lie when they say that he jdways had ten angels with him who served him in everything. At another time, this Mahomet sent a man named Gabeit, the son of Alcharith, with forty soldiers to collect booty ; and these were attacked by Abizecheim, the son of Nubar, and his companions, who defeated and dispersed these robbers, slaying some of them, and no angel of Mahomet assisted them. Again, on a third occasion, Mahomet sent a follower of his, named Gaif Ajunacar, with a number of men, to a place called Alicar or Alevafa, to seize on all the asses which were about to pass that way loaded with money and other goods, but the merchants and the asses had passed by the day before they arrived at the place, and if Mahomet had been a prophet, he would not have sent such a number of his followers on a bootless errand, for it is not usual for prophets to be baulked in their purposes. On a fourth occasion, Mahomet himself went with his followers to seize some asses with their burdens\^ but on arriving at a place called Udeny, he there discovered Mozi, the son of Gamzual Muzeni, and being quite unable to give him battle, he retreated in confusion, conquered and without any booty. A fifth time he went forth to seize some merchants\* horses laden with goods, but on arriving at a place called Nath, on the road to Aioa, he found Immarah, son of AUaha Algomachi, at sight of whom he was struck with alarm, and fled, without gaining any advantage by his expedition. On a sixth occasion he sallied forth from Carchana, to look for some asses coming from Churays into Asia, and on arriving at a place called Mahoeth, he found himself deceived, and gained nothing, and during his retreat many of his foUowers were lost or slain. In these six expeditions, it / is proved that no angels favoured his cause, and that he was not endowed with the spirit of prophecy. Oftentimes

On one occasion, he sent a man named Alchilia, son of Eagatha Alazar, to murder Achym, the son of Deden Ebrseum Maybar ; in this manner he in his hatred ordered Zely, the son of Gomahir, to go and murder Acuan, an old and infirm man, and he was killed in his bed. Again, he sent Qabdallah, the son of Geys Alapsad, with twelve of his followers, to Abla, to hear the news and bring it back to him\^ and as these men were on their road, they met Gary, the son of Melcadram, with a large sum of money, and immediately murdered him, giving a fifth part of their booty to Mahomet. Again, the son of Fhenuf went by his orders to a certain town, murdered the men, women, and children, and brought the fifth part of the booty he had seized to Mahomet, sa3ring, \"So much is your share. Prophet of Godj\" and Mahomet willingly accepted of it. Some time after this, in one of his battles, his teeth were struck out, his upper lip cut, and his jaw broken j a man named Talcha, the son of Jube of Alcha, then lifted up his hand to protect him and ward off the blows, and his finger was cut ofi!

Mahomet had a servant named Zeid, whose wife, Zemah, was a very beautiful woman, and for whom Mahomet had conceived an affection ; the servant Zeid, however, discovering this, and being aware of his master\'s sensuality, said to his wife, \" Take care that my master does not see you, for if he does, I will at once repudiate you.\" One day, however, during the servant\'s absence, Mahomet went to his house, and

And to this day this is a law amongst them, and originated from the aforesaid cause. Of this repudiated adtdteress and the toivet qf Mahomet, A certain man named Gary, the son of Abytaliph, reproved Mahomet for his adulteries, particularly because he loved this adulteress most of all his wives : \" Oh prophet of God,\" said he, \" on account of that woman whom you are keeping, you incur great scandal from every one :\" he, however, influenced by his lust, did not send her away, but palliated his adultery by false arguments. This Mahomet had fifteen wives ; two of them free women, the rest his servants : the first was Adige, daughter of Ulaith; the second was the above-mentioned repudiated adulteress ; the third was Zoda, daughter of Zunga ; the fourth was Aza, daughter of Gomar ; the fifth was Mathezelem ; to this latter one of his wives he granted whatever she liked best for a dowiy ; the sixth was Zeinah, daughter of Guar ; to this one he, in a fit of anger, swore that he would not lie with her for a month, but overcome by his lust he broke his oath and lay with her ; the seventh wife was Zeinaph, daughter of Vrynaph ; the eighth, Abbap, daughter of Abifiziel ; the ninth, Mannona, daughter of Al&ritalim ; the tenth, Geotheria, daughter of Alimisitasy ; the eleventh, Zafia, a Jewess, who was formerly called Anazalia, daughter of Haby ; the twelfth, Aculevia, daughter of Fantima ; the thirteenth, TJmaia, daughter of Aldacal ; the fourteenth was a daughter of Annomen, named HalsB Idia ; and the fifteenth was Malicha, daughter of Gathial. His servants were Miriam, daughter of Ibrasus, his son ; and Eamath, daughter of Simeon. The law of Mahomet t and the penalty for tranggresstng ii.

All those who do \^ not abide by our doctrines shall be put to death, and their wives and children be condemned to perpetual servitude.\" A mode ofrrfutation. Here Mahomet confesses with his own mouth that he never had and never should perform any miracle ; therefore those which the Saracens relate concerning him must be considered as felse. They say that a wolf once met him on the road, and that, on Mahomet\'s raising three of his fingers, the animal took to flight : they also relate a story of a bull that held converse with him : they also say that a fig-tree, on being called by him, prostrated itself to the ground, and in that way came to him : again, they state that he divided the moon into two parts and united them again. They also state that some poison was mixed with the flesh of a lamb for him by a woman named Zanab, the daughter of Acharith, and wife of Zelem, the son of MuzH Hebrseus ; but as he was sitting at table with a follower of his, named Abarah, the lamb spoke to Mahomet and said, \^\* Do not eat of me, for I am fall of poison :\" his follower Abarus did, however, eat of it, and died. Eighteen v\^ars from that day, Mahomet himself died by poison, and\^S) he had been a true prophet, he could have prayed for the life of his dead follower, or at least \\\^ have saved himself and that follower from poisoned food, as Elijah and Elisha are once said to have done, saying, \'\^ There is death in the pot.\" Death of MdkofMt, \' At the hour of death, Mahomet, knowing himself to be c2

His followers\^ therefore, kept his body for twelve days firom the day of his death, which took place on a Monday, but, seeing that his words were void of effect they buried him in the month called by the Arabs, \'\^Eabea granvil,\" in the sixtieth year from his nativity, after having kept him sick fourteen days, and watched his body thirty days to see whether it would be carried to heaven or earth, even after burial When they at length found out the truth of the matter, they proved that all which he had foretold was fidse, and they then again placed him in the tomb. The wise men seceded from his &il3i, but the simple and ignorant populace, through the preaching of his relatives and disciples, who published his law for the aEkke of gain, observed his commands in after times. After Mahomet\'s death, a man named Abuzer, son of Abubalip, by the assistance of a man named Chatab, who was a chief amongst the disciples who survived him, arose amongst them, and began with moderation to persuade every one, and by flattery to gather followers together and to excite people to join him, fearing that every one would secede from that fidth, and, being anxious to obtain the chief power therein for the friture in the place of Mahomet. But Achali, the son of Abibalip, who was the fether-in-law of Mahomet, was highly indignant at hearing this, and, being influenced by desire of gain and worldly honour, persevered in his efforts till he had deprived him of his sovereign authority. Another of them named Xenes, one of the followers of Mahomet, endeavoured by various stratagems and promises to recall to their £uth those who had seceded from it ; some he brought over to his &ith by threats, others he seduced by means of worldly pleasures, until at length immense numbers returned to that &ith. Other people too in distant parts of the world, hearing of the luxury and carnal pleasures permitted and enjoined \\\^ by that law, willingly received it, considering the Christian religion and chastity as much too strict and severe, and thus a host of people were seduced to paganism.

There, this apostate monk and the father-in-law of Mahomet met, and, after a conference, became Mends. The monk changed his name, taking that of Nastorius, and taught him many pro- . phesies and attestations out of the Old and New Testa- \^ ment, and the writings of the Prophets, which he skilfully annexed to the law of Mahomet, and thus, by the aid and advice of these men, this seducer began to be exalted above all the tribes ; forjbhe men were rude, uncultivated, and of\^a gmple character, easy to be led away, and carnally disposed according to the words of the Prophet. £t nos in vitiam prona caterya somus. \[We are but cattle prone to yice.\] The belief qf the Saracens according to the commande qf Mahomet. Many of the Saracens believe that there is one God, the Creator of all men : they have, however, no belief in the Trinity, which they reject entirely. According to the writings of Mahomet they abominate idolatry, for he mixed some good doctrines with his evil ones, in order the more \^ warily to make persons drink his poison seasoned with honey. They state that our Lord Jesus Christ was bom of the Virgin Mary, by the Holy Ghost, and they say that he was a Creator by the virtue of God, as also, they say was Adam, for they place him on a level with Adam, or Moses, or one of the prophets. They also believe that he was taken to Heaven and still is alive there, for, as he came from God, so he has returned to, and remains with God, and they expect that he will still reign for forty years on earth, ffis crucifixion, suffering, and death, they altogether deny, and say that some other man was substituted to suffer in his stead, and, that when he was about to suffer, it became so dark in order that this might not be found out. They also declare that, from the days of JSToah, all the patriarchs and prophets, and .Jesus Christ himself have observed the same law as they, and by it have been saved. They say that we have

22 KATTHEW PABUL \[a.D. 1236# perverted the law of the Grospel, and have erased the name of Mahomet from it. For the scripture of the Saracens has it that, before the heavens and the earth were made, the name of Mahomet, existed with God, and if there had been no Mahomet, there would have been no heaven, earth, paradise, or hell ; wherefore, from this sole sentence, so pregnant with folly, all wise Saracens may see the vanity of his other doctrines. They expect and believe in the resurrection, but they say that, at the day of judgment, no one of their adherents will perish or be doomed to punishment, but that they will all be saved. For they say, that all who keep their law will obtain salvation of God by the intercession of Mahomet, and will never be punished. They believe that, after this temporal life, they will live eternally, and dwell for ever in paradise, whence there flow forth rivers of honey, wine, and milk, for the enjoyment of every one living there ; and that whatever any of them may ask to eat and drink, will at once be sent to them from heaven. Also, that however many male or female children any one of them may de\^ie to be bom, they shall at once be bom to him ; they de\* clare that there no one vill mourn or be sorrowful, but that they shall be refreshed with various and universal delights and enjoy endless felicity, and they believe that the advantages, riches, and pleasures of the present life will not prevent their ftiture happiness. Of marriage amonggt the Saracens, According to their law, a man may take three or four wives, if he has sufficient means to support them; their wives ought to be free women ; but of female slaves and concubines, they keep as many as they can manage or feed ; contrary to what is said in Gf\'.nesis, « There shall be two in one flesh :\" it does not say, \" three or four.\" Again, Lamech, who first introduced polygamy, was rebuked by Grod, and punished worse than the first murderer. K any one among them is displeased with his wife, or if any contention, dispute, or hatred arises between them, a divorce is at once effected both on the part of the husband and of the wife, and each releases the other. If, however, a man, after putting away his wife, repents of so doing, and wishes her to be restored to him, unless she has previously formed a connexion with

T\^eir mpersHtion. They chiefly have connexion with their wives during their time of festing, thinking that they the better please God by this. They fest only one month in the year, and then from the morning till night ; from the beginning of the night till the morning they eat continually ; on their days of &sting it is not proper for them to pray with an empty belly, but then they mostly have intercourse with their wives, as if they will obtain a greater recompense. K at the time of fasting any one is sick, or troubled in any way, or is on a pilgrimage, he is allowed to eat, and to renew his Ousting when he is restored to healtL At their time of &sting they eat flesh and all richer sorts of food, except wine. They hold no intercourse with their wives when pregnant, but only before conception, alleging as an honourable motive, that they ought not to do it unless to obtain oflspring. They always perform their devotions looking towards the south ; and they reverence Friday above all other days. In their judgments, whoever is accused of murder, if he is proved guilty, by any witnesses, is at once condemned to death as an atonement for his crime ; and in their law it is written, \" If any one does not observe the law, and denies Mahomet, let him be kept till the third day j and if he does not then repent, let him be put to death.\" Some further fads concerning the said Mahomet, As we have commenced to give an account of this impostor, Mahomet, which we heard from a celebrated preacher of great renown, who preached in rebuke of the law of the said Mahomet, having been sent to the countries of the East for that especial purpose, we have thought proper to insert it in these pages. The aforesaid Mahomet taught and wrote in his book the Alcoran (which the Saracens use, and consider as authentic as Christians do the Gospel), that the first and chief command of God, in importance as well as in point of

---

24 MATTHSW \^ABia \[a.d. 1336. time, was this, \" Increase and multiply ;\" and \"whoever disobeys this commandment sins irremediably. Hence, in order that the Saracen nation might multiply, like horses and mules, which have no understanding, MaJiomet ordered and .enjoined on them to have as many wives and concubines as they could support, and to use and abuse them at their plear sure ; and if any one has a less number than he could feed and govern, regard being had for his property, he is accused of transgressing the law, and of avarice, and more are assigned to him by the decision of the authorities. Thus Mahomet thought little of angelic virginity as being barren, and, / slighting continence, condemned it as imfruitful, not considerv ing that the Lord gave only one Eve to one Adam as a helpmate and to bring him an offspring. Thus, therefore, Mahomet, by multiplying wives, established polygamy, not being warned by the example of Lamech, that man of blood, who was the first to introduce bigamy, and afterwards paid for his crime, was reproved by the Lord, and blotted from the face of the earth by the flood. Hence it is that the weak and effeminate Saracens give loose to lust and unclean\^ ness, following the orders of their most filthy prophet, Mahomet, who introduced this custom only to propagate and \'W increase his sect and people, and thus to strengthen his law by their numbers, and that in this might be fulfilled what is . written in Bevelations, \'\* The dragon with his tail has dragged \^\'\\ a portion of the stars from heaven.\" Truly was this Mahomet a poisonous dragon, a beast blooded with the slaughter of many, sucking in a river and not wondering, stiU having confidence that \" the Jordan will flow into his mouth.\" For this said false prophet Mahomet declared that Gkxl said to him, \'\' Son of man, Mahomet, go not in the ways of other prophets, who have been before you, in miracles, signs, and prodigies. He who wishes to believe, and by his belief to be saved, let him of his own accord, uninfluenced by miracles, come to the £dth, in order that, by his good will, a greater reward may be accumulated for him ;\" and this he pretended, knowing that his merits were not of so much importance in the sight of God, that Gkxl would work any miracle for him. He moreover stated, and preached, and wrote (it is not known on what grounds or authority he relied), that there had only been three prophets, and that there would not be

When therefore the time of the law was expired, the Gospel succeeded ; when the time of the Gospel expired, the law of Mahomet succeeded, as if supplying the defects of the aforesaid which were past. Hence it is that Mahomet, wishing to please the believers of both Testaments, preached some doctrines which appertain to the law, and others pertaining to the Grospel ; circumcision from the Old Testament, baptism from the JSTew. For the Saracens are circumcised, and also waah the lower parts of their bodies in running water, that they may thus be purified bv some sort of baptism. Again, they believe that Jesus Chri\^ was conceived and bom of the Virgin, according to the Gospel of Luke, who says, \" An angel was sent,\" &c., but they deny that he was God ; they, however, affirm that he was the greatest of the prophets. They also declare that there will be a resurrection of the dead at the end of the world. When Mahomet was asked about the deluge, the ark of Noah, and the universal extermination caused by the flood, of which Moses writes in Genesis, as to whether it was true and ought to be believed, he in reply said to his disciples, --- Jesus, the chief prophet, when passing through the coimtry of Jerusalem, was asked by his disciples concerning this matter, and impressed on their wavering minds the certainty of such an occurrence, and, seeing a piece of turf near his feet, he kicked it, saying, \" Arise Japhet, son of Noah ;\" on this Japhet arose, as it .were, from the piece of turf, a large and tall gray-headed man, and stood in astonishment and alarm. Jesus then asked him why he was afraid, to which he replied, \" Lord, I was alarmed at hearing the trumpet of thy voice, believing that I was called to the general judgment of the resurrection.\" Jesus then replied, \"Do not fear, for the hour of resurrection and judgment is not yet arrived ; I summoned you from the dead in order that you, who were in the ark with your father, may relate to these people round me the -whole truth of this matter.\" Japhet, then, taking up his

26 KATTHEW PARIS. \[a.D. 1236. parable, thus commenced his narrative : \" When the deluge overwhelmed the earth, we were in the ark, the men in one part, and the animals and beasts in their third story, which was on one side of the ark, and the hay and com on the other side. After a lapse of four months the ark began to heel over and incline to that side on which the cattle were placed. The animals, accumulating dung, having by degrees consumed the com distributed for their eating, overbalanced the ark ; one side, that where the com was placed, was raised, and the side which contained the animals was depressed, and we were in danger, and became greatly alarmed, and we did not dare to do any great work without asking advice of the Lord. We therefore made a sacrifice and offered up prayers, and the Lord being appeased, said to us, \* Make for yourselves a pile for an altar out of the earthy matter collected &om the dung of men and camels, and when you have made a sacrifice on it, you will receive a remedy for your tribulation.\' After we had done so, there arose iroxo. the pile a very large kind of sow, which at once placed itself in the hold of the vessel, and, dispersing the great heap of earth, by which the ark had been nearly upset, thus efiected our preservation. After some days, however, when its work was accomplished, this sow, being now useless, became quite abominable to us, and it was the opinion of some that it ought to be thrown into the sea, but as it had been given to us by God, and had effected our preservation, we bore with it, although unwillingly. As a punishment for this offence, the Lord sent a plague on us in the following manner : the sow, as it were, sneezing, emitted from its nostrils a number of large hungry mice, which, overrunning the ark, did great damage to us, by gnawing and destroying its joints and ropes, and devouring the com ; and thus the sow, which at our request was given us to help us, became, owing to our transgression, a soui\'ce of injury. When at length we repented and cried to the Lord in our trouble, he was appeased, and said, \' You have with you a lion j strike him on the forehead with a hammer, not however to kill him, and you will obtain safety.\' When we had struck him according to the order of the Lord, he, with a roar, emitted a cat from his mouth, which destroyed the mice and released the ark from their annoyance. And that you may not

A.D. 1236.\] FURTHER rACTS CONCERNING HAHOHET. 27 doubt that the sow sprang from the dung of men and of the camel, this plain argument proves ; for the sow in its inner parts is like a man, and in its exterior, as it is of the race of quadrupeds, is not unlike a camel, and always delights in digging up and turning over heaps of earth and dung. And that you may believe that mice came forth from its nostrils, mice always burrow and dwell in holes in the earth, whence it is called a mouse, from the moisture of the eartL And that you may not doubt that a cat proceeded from the mouth of the lion, a cat is like a lion, as if descended from the same species, in its disposition of body and in its plundering and robbery of food. From that time the ark floated safely till thei deluge was at an end. --- Thus, Mahomet asserted that Japhet informed Christ and his disciples, who asked him about the ark ; but to any wise man this seems frivolous, and entirely dissonant with truth. By such empty discourses, this inveigler of souls, Mahomet, infatuated the minds of many persons. In his early life he was exalted and raised from the lowest condition by a noble woman named Adige, whom he had seduced and polluted by a clandestine connexion,, and afterwards married ; he then began to boast and exalt himself above all the powerful and wise men of the East, usurping the name and ofice of a prophet. The Lord therefore struck him with incurable epilepsy, and when it attacked him, he frequently fell down, as those who suffer from that disease usually do, on which, in order that he might not lose his accustomed authority, and thus be treated with contempt, he pretended that he was conferring and advising for tJie salvation of man with the archangel Gabriel, and could not endure his splendour standing. It happened one day, when surfeited with feasting and wine, in which, according to his preaching, he greatly indulged\^ that he fell on a dungheap overcome by illness, assisted, as was stated, by poison administered to him in his food that day by some nobles who were indignant at his pride. There he lay, in tortures, rolling about and vomiting, owing to his sins, and deprived of all consolation from his followers ; whilst lying there half dead, he was discovered by an ugly sow, with an unweaned litter of pigs, and being stuffed with food, the smell of which he breathed forth, and parts pf which he had brought up in his sickness, he was

But by the diligent ministry and anwearied preaching of the Minorites, Preachers, and Theologians, and especially of one of the order of Preachers\^ Bobert (who was samamed Bogre, because he had been converted from that foith and assomed the habit of a Preacher), and who was called the hammer of the heretics, their superstition was confounded, and their error was discovered.

The emperor complained most severely of the city of Milan, which was the nurse and protectress of heretics and rebels against the empire, to attack which place he had in the same year assembled a large army. His son Henry, who was accused of treachery against his &ther, he detained in close confinement. A cor\^erence held at London. In the same year, on the 28th of April, the nobles of England assembled at a council at London, to disQo\^ the affiurs of the kingdom. It was a cause of astonishment to many that the knrg i&Uowed the advice of the bishop elect of Yalentia more than he ought, despising, as it appeared to them, his own natural subjects, and at this they were F\^ \'\"\^ annoyed, and accused the king of fickleness, saying amongst themselves, \" Why does not this bishop elect betake himself to the kingdom of France, as the French king has married the elder sister of our queen, to manage the affidrs of the French kingdom, like he does here, by reason of his niece the queen of that country T And they were highly indignant. On the first day of the council the king went to the Tower of London, and gave great cause of discontent to many about this matter, and more unfavourable than prosperous ooi\\jectures were entertained. The nobles would not either singly or in numbers go to the Tower to the king, fearing lest he, yielding to evil counsel, should vent his rage on them, and b\^ng warned by the words of Horace, --- Quia me vestigia terrent Omnia te venum spectantia, nulla retrorrom. \[Became the footsteps of these beasts all point towards your den, But none of them, as fur I can see, come back again.\] The king, nevertheless, restrained by motives of prudence, went from the Tower to his palace, there to discuss tiie urgent

After discussing several matters, he came to one praiseworthydetermination, which was, that all the sheri\^ should be dismissed, and others appointed in their places, because they had been corrupted by bribes and deviated from the paths of truth and justice. The king, therefore, substituted in their places men who possessed more tenements, who were richer, and of more noble race, who would not be driven by necessity to covet presents, nor to be corrupted. He also made them sweax that they would not a\^sept any gifts, unless in food and drink, and that only moderately and not to excess ; or any present of land by way of reward, by which justice would be corrupted. To this council the kmg of Scotland sent special messen\^rs, who urgently demanded from the king the rights which pertained to their lord, the said king of Scots, concerning which they said that they held a charter and had the testimony of a great many nobles; but the determination of this matter was put ofif for the present. At the same time, too, the king, becaiise he could not reestablish peace between Earl Bichard, his brother, and Kichard Seward, banished the latter from the kingdom, saying that he would rather incur his anger than that of his brother. He also, to the astonishment of many, removed from their offices and dismissed from his councils, Ealph Fitz-Nicholas, seneschal of his palace, and several other high officers of his household. He also demanded instantly lus seal from the bishop of Chichester, his chancellor ; although he had blamelessly discharged the duties of his office, proving himself a remarkable pillar of truth at court. This, however, the chancellor refused to do, seeing that the king\'s violence exceeded the bounds of moderation, and said that he could on no account give it up, since he had undertaken the charge by the general consent of the kingdom, and therefore could not resign it without that same consent. About the same time, too, the emperor sent messengers to the king, demanding from him a large sum of money which he, the king, had promised him with his sister.

This battle took place in the month of April, the fortune of war fiivouring the king of Scots. A disturbance in the French kingdom.

About this same time, in the month of May, near an abbacy called Boche, in the northern part of England, there appeared bands of well-armed knights, riding on valuable horses, with standards and shields, coats of mail and helmets, and decorated with other mihtary equipments : they issued from the /I ; earth, as it appeared, and disappeared again into the eartL This vision lasted for several days, and attracted the eyes of those who beheld it, as if by fascination; they rode in arrayed troops, and sometimes engaged in conJQict ; sometimes as if at a tournament, they shivered their spears into small fragments with a crash ; the inhabitants saw them, but more from a distance than near them, for they never remember to have seen such a sight before, and many said that the occurrence was not without its presage. This occiured more plainly in Ireland and its confiiies, where they appeared as if coming fr\^m battle, and dragged their horses after them wounded and broken down, without a rider, and the knights themselves were severely wounded and bloody : and what \^ more wonderful, thei track plainly appeared impressed on the ground, and the grass was borne down and trampled on. Many people on seeing this vision fled before them in alarm, and betook themselves to the churches and castles, thinking that it was not an illusion, but a real battle.

Pacification qf the French nobles. In the same year, as the summer was drawing to a close, the nobles of France, who had engaged in the disturbance of that kingdom, made some terms of peace, and were received into favour by the king. About this time, too, some bold but rash young nobles in England --- we know not by what spirit seduced--- conspired together and entered into an execrable alliance to ravage iElagland, like robbers and nightwalkers. Their designs, however, became known ; and the chief of the conspiracy, one Peter de Buffer, a door-keeper of the king, was taken prisoner, and by him others were accused. A dreadful machine, commonly called a gibbet, was erected at London to hang them on ; and on it two of the chief conspirators were suspended, after having engaged in single combat ; and one of them being killed in the struggle, was hung with his head cleft open ; and the other, living, breathed forth his miserable life an the same gibbet, amidst the lamentations of the multitude assembled. A ditagreeement between the citizeilts of Orleans and the clergy. In the same year, about Whitsuntide, a lamentable dissension sprung up between the clergy and the citizens at the city of Orleans, which originated about, and was promoted by, a chattering, brawling woman ; and the tumult was fanned up and increased to such a pitch, that some scholars, illustrious youths of noble family, were slain in the city by the townsmen. Amongst these were the nephew of the Count de la Marche, the nephew of the count of Champagne, king of Navarre, a relation by blood of the count of Brittany, a blood relation of the noble baron Erkenwidd de Bourbon, and many others, some of whom were drowned in the river Loire, and others were killed ; some, however, escaped with difficulty, and, hiding themselves hi caves, vineyards, and other secret places\^ thus escaped death.

The above-named nobles, too, hearing of the murder of their relatives, attacked the city, and put many of the inhabitants to death at the sword\'s point, without awaiting the formality of a trial ; some others, too, they, with their swords still reeking with blood, beheaded on the road as they were returning &om some market with their panniers laden with merchandise. This sedition did not cease till the royal mandate, at the wish of both parties, made terms between them, and calmed the tumult. About the same time, too, several cities and provinces of the French kingdom were laid under an interdict ; amongst which were Eheims, Amiens\^ Beauvais, and other places, schisms having arisen amongst them from various causes. A discord which sprang up at (ktford. In the same year, a quarrel arose between the clergy and the citizens of Oxford, and it was with difficulty, and after a long time, that the strife was lulled to rest by the interference of the king and nobles, the bishops, and o&er men of rank and authority, and the university restored to its former state. In the month of August x£ the same year, the bishops\^ John of Worcester, and Thomas of Norwich, departed this life ; and about the same -time died Henry, abbat of Croyland, a man of illustrious \^unily, and renowned for his piety, after having governed his church, almost the whole of which, together with the buildings, he had rebuilt, for nearly fifty years.

For to wise men, who weighed future events in the scale of reason, it seemed foolish that the kingdom of England, surrounded on all sides by enemies on the continent, should secretly generate internal hatred. The origin of this discord was (it is said) as follows : --- \^The king of Scotland had constantly demanded the county of Northumberland, which King John had given him as a marriage portion with his daughter Johanna, and for which he declared that he held a charter.

He also added, that unless the English king would peaceably give him what plain reason proved to be his right, he would seek it at the sword\'s point. He was inspii-ed with confidence by the secret, although suspected, friendship of Llewellyn, and by his alliance and sanity with Gilbert Marshal, who had married his sister Margaret, a most handsome lady. The hostility of his continental states, too, was always in conspiracy against him, and moreover, his cause was lust, as was proved by the muniments of fom\^er kings. After much disciLion on both sides, the king of England, for the sake of peace, and for the protection of his kingdom, as £9ir as lay in his power, offered the king of Scots a revenue of eighty markTfrom some other part of England, in order that the boundaries of his kingdom might not be broken in upon in the northern . parts. But whilst he waited imtil the affair should be settled to the satisfaction of both parties, the conference ended, and all for the moment remained at peace. About that time, the knight, Philip Daubeney, a noble devoted to God, and brave in battle, after fighting for the Lord during several pilgrimages to the Holy Land, at length closed his life by a praiseworthy death there, and obtained a holy burial in the Holy Lan\^ which he had long desired when living. 7%e preaching qf the crtuade, Li the same year, on a warrant from the pope, a solemn preaching was made, both in England and France, by the brethren of the orders of Preachers and Minorites, and other famous clerks, theologians, and religious men, granting to those who would assume the cross, a full remission of the sins of which they truly repented and made confession. These preachers wandered about amongst cities, castles, and villages, promising to those who assumed the cross much relief in temporal matters, namely, that interest should not accumulate against them with the Jews, and the protection of his holiness the i)ope for all their incomes and property given in pledge to procure necessaries for their journey, and

The pope afterwards sent also Master Thomas, a Templar, his familiar, into England, with his warrant, to absolve those crusaders, whom he chose and thought expedient, fh\>m their vow of pilgrimage, on receiving money from them, which he considered that he could expend advantageously for the promotion of the cause of the Holy Land. When the crusaders saw this, they wondered at the insatiable ja\^reediness of the Roman court, and conceived great indignation in their minds, because the Romans endeavoured thus impudently to drain their purses by so many devices. For the Preachers added, that if any one, whether he had assumed the cross or not, should be unable in person to undertake such a toilsome journey, he must not omit to contribute as much of his property as his means permitted, for the assistance of the Holy Land, and that thus he would fully enjoy the before-mentioned indulgence ; but all these things rendered their hearers suspicious ; for they said, \'\* Will our dispenser prove feithful \]\" And so it turned out ; for the pope, conceiving indignation against the people, made war, extorted money, collected a tenth part from all countries, and accumulated an endless sum of money to defend the Church ; but peace was soon made, and he and the emperor became friends ; the money, however, was never restored, and thus the devotion of many became daily weakened, and their confidence was abated.

He moreover wondered beyond measure that the pope should be in any way favourable to the Milanese, or should seem in any manner to afford them protection, since it became him to be a father to

In reverence, however, for such a great fiither as his holiness the jjope, the emperor modestly and prudently replied to him as follows. The ew\^eror\'a answer to the pope. \" Italy is my inheritance, and this is well known to all the world. To covet the property of others and abandon my own, would be ambitious and mnful, particularly as the insolence of the Italians, and especially the Milanese, has provoked me, showing no proper respect to me in any way. Moreover, I am a Christian, and, however unworthy a servant of Christ, I am prepared to subdue the enemies of the cross. Since, therefore, so many heresies are not only springing up, but are even growing thick in Italy, and the tares are beginning to choke the wheat throughout the cities of Italy, / and especially Milan, to proceed to subdue the Saraoens and to leave these unpunished, would be to rub the\^ounjvhere the steel has enjb\^d with sjiperficial fomentations, and to cause an ugly(»ca\^not a\^c\^\^ Again, I am alone and am human, and therefore not capable of such a great undertaking as that of subduing the enemies of the cross, without a great force to assist me ; as they are so numerous and powerful Again, as I am not of myself sufficient to carry out such an arduous matter without a great deal of money, I have determined to apply the wealth of the said country to lend assistance to, and to avenge the crucified One; for Italy abounds in arms, horses, and wealth, as all the world knows.\" The emperor marehee into Italy to take Milan, The pope, on hearing such profound reasonings, in order that he might .not seem opposed to such incontrovertible arguments,(pr6tende9to give his consent ; and that he might cross the mountains and enter Italy according to his purpose, his holiness promised, without fail, as far as he was able, to afford him his paternal assistance in every necessity. The (j?\^ emperor, encouraged by this, having by an imperial edict eellected all the forces he could muster, entered Italy, followed by a large body of troops. \*The Milanese, not without reason, fearing his terrible anger, sent to the pope, asking advice and effectual assistance from him ; and he, after receiving a large sum of monev. with a promise of more, sent them much relief and assistance, to the injury of the emperor, and this ■W

The citizens then sallied forth from the city in great force, to the number of about fifty thousand armed men, and proceeded with their standard (which they called \" carruca,\" or \" carrochium,\") to meet the emperor, sending word that they were ready to fight him. About this time, a certain knight named Baldwin de Vere, had come fix)m England as a messenger from the English king to the emperor, to arrange some secret business concerning the said king and the emperor ; and on all these matters he afterwards gave his hearers full information. When the emperor heard that the Milanese had broken out into such audacity as to kick against him, he at once prognosticated that they had conceived this boldness, depending on the support of others than themselves ; and after the matter had been carefully weighed in council with his nobles, it was agreed by acclamation that all who were present on the side of the emperor, from the highest to the lowest, should, without delay, fly to arms and attack this Milanese rabble, which dared, like mice coming from their holes, to provoke their lord to battle and to try their strength with the imperial forces. When this determination was made known to the Milanese, they halted for a little, and one of the elder citizens, on whose judgment the opinion of all depended, arranged the others in a circle around him and spoke as follows : \" Hear me, noble citizens. The emperor is at hand in great power and with a large army, and he, as is known to the whole world, is our lord. If this lamentable struggle should take place, irreparable harm will arise fi\^m it ; for if we are victorious in it, we shall obtain a reproachful and bloody victory over our lord, but if we are conquered, he will destroy our name, and that of our people and our dty for ever, and we shall be a disgrace to every nation. Since, therefore, in every event it is dishonourable and dangerous to proceed further in a hostile manner, I consider it a wise plan to return to our city, where, if he chooses to attack us, it wiU be lawful for us to repel force by force ; and whether he allows us to make peace with him, or compels us to drive him fr\^m our territory by force, our city will be preserved and our good name will remain unimpaired.\" All the rest

Whilst all these events were passing, either by the instrumentality of the Eoman church, or the enemies of the emperor, an internal discord was stirred up in the German provinces, by the duke of Austria, to quell which, letters and messengers were sent with all haste, explaining the great urgency of the case, and to summon him to return immediately. The emperor therefore raised the siege, for which he had made preparations, and returned into Germany, and the Milanese, on hearing this, seized by force on some castles, which the emperor had taken, and their garrisons, and put all the knights and soldiers of the emperor to death. When the emperor heard of this, he was much enraged, and not without good reason, and poured \^ forth all his just indignation against the author of this evil \\ and pimished the duke of Austria, by depriving him of his honours, lands, castles, and cities, scarcely granting him his life ; so that vengeance for the crime perpetrated by him against King Bichard, on his return &om the Holy Land, seemed even at this time unsatisfied, as the prophet says, \"Although late, God severely punishes wickedness,\" and \' \" visits the sins of the fathers on the children to the third A\^ and fourth generation.\" In this year, about Michaelmas-day, Baldwin de Vere, a discreet, &ith\^ and eloquent man, returned to England and brought the emperor\'s reply to the king, and gave a full account of all those matters to all who chose to listen to him. About the same time, too, Peter, bishop of Winchester, returned fiom the continent, deprived of his bodily strength by disease. Near about the same time, too, namely on the Monday following that feast, deluges of rain fell in the northern parts of England, to such a degree that the rivers and lakes, overflowing their usual bounds, caused great damage by destroying bridges, mills, and other property near the banks. In the same year, on the 16th of August, died Thomas de Blundeville, bisiiop of Norwich.

On the day after the feast of St. Martin, and within the octaves of that feast, great inundations of the sea suddenly broke forth by night, and a fierce storm of wind arose, which caused inundations of the rivers as well as of the sea, and in places, especially on the coast, drove the ships &om their ports, tearing them from their anchors, drowned great numbers of people, destroyed flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, tore up trees by the roots, overthrew houses, and ravaged the coast. The sea rose for two days and the intermediate night, a circumstance before unheard of, and did not ebb and flow in its usual way, being impeded (as was said) by the violence of the opposing winds. The dead bodies ot those drowned were seen lying unburied in caves formed by the sea, near the coast, and at Wisbeach and the neighbouring villages, and along the seacoast, an endless number of human beings perished : in one town, and that not a populous one, about a hundred bodies were consigned to the tomb in one Jay. In the night of Christmas eve, also, a very fierce storm of wind raged, attended by thunder and a deluge of rain, and shook towers and other buildings, and the confusion of the elements rendered the roads and seas impassable. And thus in that year about the equinoctial season, the storm twice repeated ravaged England with irreparable damage. The Lord indeed seemed, owing to the sins of the people, to have sent this fiood as a scourge to the earth, and to fulfil the threat contained in the Gospel, --- \" There shall be upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring.\" .

When they had all taken their seats, there stood up in the midst of them, one William de Kaele, a clerk and familiar of the king\'s, a discreet man and well skilled in the laws of the land, who, acting as a sort of mediator between the king and the nobles, disclosed to them the king\^s pleasure and intentions. \" My lord the king,\" he said, \" informs you that, whatever he may have done heretofore, he now and henceforth will, without hesitation, submit himself to the advice of all of you, as his faithful and natural subjects.

When the king heard this, he wished to calm the general discontent, and promised on oath that he would never again provoke or annoy the nobles of the kingdom by injuring them in that way, provided that the thirtieth part of all moveable property in England was granted and paid to him for his present use ; because the large sum of money which he had a little while before sent to the emperor (as he stated) for the marriage of his sister, and also what he had spent at his own marriage, had in a great degree exhausted his money. To this they openly replied that he, the king, had done all this without the advice of his liege subjects, and they ought not to share the punishment as they were innocent of the crime. They however withdrew to a private place to consult about obeying the king\'s demand, and supplying his necessities, and to discuss the kind and quantity of assistance which was demanded. As they were withdrawing for this purpose, Gilbert Bassett said to the king in the hearing of all, and with less drcomspection of speech than he ought, --- \" My lord king, send some one of your friends to be present at the conference of your barons.\" He was, when he said this, sitting on one side of the king, with only a few persons between them, and, in reply to his speech, Bichard Percy, who had been at the conference of the nobles, and was, not without cause, angry at it, \\j said, \" What is it, fHend Gilbert, that you said \] are we too ,-,\\\> \'\^foreigners, and are we not amongst the number of the king\'s friends \] \" And Gilbert felt himself rebuked by this impleasant and sudden speecL And thus by a multiplicity of arguments the conference was protracted for four days.

It was also determined that it would be harsh to remove from the king the coimciUors he at present had, as if they were wicked ; they therefore strengthened their number by the addition of some other nobles, appointing the Earl Warrenne, William Ferrers, and John Fitz-G\^offi:ey as additional ones; and the king, as he had formerly done at Windsor, made them swear that they would in no wise, for presents or by any other means, deviate from the path of truth, but would give him, the king, good advice, and what was for the benefit of the kingdom. On these conditions a grant of the thirtieth part of all moveable property in the kingdom was made to the king, to replenish his treasury, saving, however, to every one his silver and gold, his horses and arms, which would be devoted for the public advantage ; which thirtieth part was to be collected throughout each county in the following manner and form : --- Four trustworthy knights were to be chosen, besides one clerk, whom the king would appoint ; and these knights, together with the cler\^ having taken an oath of fealty to the Mug, were to collect the money, which, when collected, was to be placed in some convent, sabred liouse, or castle, so that if the king should endeavour to

The archbishop of Canterbury and his bishops and clergy first agreed to this ; and on this condition, the thirtieth part of all moveable property in the kingdom was granted to the king, to be collected throughout the whole kingdom in general from every prelate and knight according to the tenement of his barony. It was, however, often annexed to the conditions, that the king would then and thenceforth reject the advice ofdbreignera5(who were always friends to themselves, and not to the kingdom, and generally wasted its wealth instead of increasing it), and of all unnatural advisers, and would abide by the counsel of his liege and natural subjecta The council then thus broke up, not however before a great deal of secret anger and discontent was excited, because it was with great difficulty that they , \^L\^ could turn the king\'s mind to their wholesome counsel, and K\'\' induce him to comply with the advice of those from whom he held all earthly honour ; and each returned to his home. Victoriea of the ChrisHani in Spain, In the same year, churches and prelates were ordained at Cordova, a large city of Spain, which, as has been before mentioned, was taken on Tuesday in Easter-week. In this city Lucan states that he was bom, and says, \'\' Cordova gave me birth.\" It was captured by Alphonso, the most Christian king of Castile ; and on its surrender to the Christians, joy was heaped upon joy, by the capture also of the great and rich pagan island of Majorca, which was filled with pirates and vagabonds, and was most particularly inimical to the merchants and pilgrims who travelled by sea between the countries of Africa and Spain. This i\^and contains thirty-two castles. And to increase our joy, in the year last past the large city of Burianna was taken, and also the most impregnable castle of Peniscola by the king of Arragon ;\* and thus he fulfilled by exquisite cunning what it was impossible to accomplish by force.

William, bishop elect of Valentia, leaves Englandf but soon returns. About this time William, bishop elect of Valentia, to whom the king had entirely intrusted the reins of government, seeing that the nobles had, not without reason, conceived fireat indisnaation against him, on that account took his departure for his ownTuntry ; his lands and rich farms, which the king had given him, he placed in the hands of Aaron, a Jew of York, in the form of a pledge, receiving from him, by way of loan, nine hundred marks of new sterling money in hand. He then directed his steps towards Dover, under the guidance of the king himself wi\^ the packsaddles of his beasts of burden full of gold, silver, and divers royal presents, besides some desirable jennets and valuable saddlehorses.

The Norwich monks elected their prior, a religious and discreet man, to be their head ; but lus election, Sthough duly made, displeased the king, and, owing to the ridiculous reasonings and objections of some who opposed it, was for a long time hung in suspense, not without certain scruples arising from suspected misdeeds. The wretched condition of England. During all this time, the small fire of the true faith began to die away, so that it was almost reduced to ashes, and seemed scarcely to emit a single spark. Fordam\^iJ\'rwas now practised without a blush, and usurers openly, by various arguments, extorted money from the people and from minors ; charity expired ; the liberty of the church was crushed ; religion was trodden upon, and of no value ; and the daughter of Sion became, as it were, a shameless harlot without a blush. Illiterate persons, of the lowest class, armed with the bulls of the Eoman church, bursting forth into threats, daily presumed, despite of the sacred privileges we enjoy from owe holy ancestors, to plunder the reveiiues left l)y pious men of old times for the maintenance of religious men, for the support of the poor, and to afibrd hospitality to pilgrims ; and, by thundering forth sentences of excommunication, they at once obtained what they demanded. And if any of the injured or robbed parties resorted to the remedy of appeal, or to the plea of privilege, they immediately suspended and excommunicated them by means of some other prelate, on the authority of a warrant from the pope, and in this way, not by prayers, not canonically, but by imperious extortion, did they rob the simple-minded, according to the saying of the poet, --- Armato supplicat ense potens. \[The man in power begs with a drawn sword.\]

A.D. 1237.\] DEATH OP JOHN DE BRIENNE. 51 Hence it came to pass that, where formerly noble and bountiful clerks, guardians and patrons of churches, used to make themselves renowned throughout the whole of the adjacent country, by entertaining traveUers and refreshing the poor, there debased men, void of morals, and full of cunning, agents and farmers of the Romans, now scraped together all that was useful and valuable, and transmitted it to foreign countries to their lords, who were living daintily on the patrimony of Christ, and bragging on the possessions of others. Then was to be seen heartfelt grief, the cheeks of the saints became wet with tears, and sighs and complaints were heard to burst forth and multiply, and many said with a sigh, \" It were better to die than to behold the sufferings of our people and our saints.\" Woe to England ! which, once the chief of provinces, mistress of nations, the mirror of the church, and a pattern of religion, is now\' laid under tribute ; ignoble men have trampled heiTunder-foot, and she has &Ilen a prey to degenerate men. But the manifold offences of the English have brought these scourges on themselves, through the anger of Him, who, for the sins of the people, makes the hypocrite to reign, and the tyrant to bear rule. Death qfJohn de Brienne and of brother Jordan. In this year was taken from amongst us the renowned John de Brienne, of immortal memory, formerly king of Jerusalem, and who had almost attained the imperial sovereignty of the Greeks ; who would have closed a happy and peaceful life in sunshine, if he had not brought on himself the enmity of the great Frederick, the emperor of the Germans. Between winter and spring of this year, too, brother Jordan, prior of the order of Preachers, a man of distinguished sanctity and a renowned preacher, was drowned in a storm, whilst sailing along the coast of the southern barbarians, for the purpose of gaining them to God by his preaching. TTift body was brought to land by some of those shipwrecked, whom chance had snatched from death, although with much labour and danger, and consigned to the tomb in an honourable and becoming manner.

About the same time, namely on the 15th of April, died Ilichard, the second bishop of Durham of that name ; a man of unparalleled piety and profound learning, who had strenuoudy ruled over three episcopal churches ; namely, those of Chichester, Salisbury, and, fiiudly, that of Durham, which he had presided over with aU prosperity, and had released it from a heavy debt, incurred by the first Eichard, sumamed Marsh, his predecessor. The sum of money which the aforesaid bishop, the second Bichard, paid by way of settlement of the debt, was reckoned at more than four thousand marks. It also redounds to his immortal praise, that he transferred the church of Salisbury from a hollow, dry place in the neighbourhood of the earl\'s castle, to a fitting situation, and by the help of some &mous architects, whom he had summoned from distant provinces, he laid a large foundation, and himself placed the first stone ; to promote which work, not only the bishop, but also the king, and a great many nobles, lent a helping hand. Hence some versifier gives, --- Rex largitur opes, fert pnesal opem, lapicidse Dant operam ; tribus bis est opus, at stet opus, \[The king finds money, the stonemason hands, The bishop aids, and so the building stands.\] Besides this, he founded an establishment of nuns, at Tarent\^ and g\^ive it to the queen, where he chose his burial-place. When the time of his dissolution drew nigh, the bishop, see\^ ing that the hour was come for him to pass from this world, preached a special discourse to the assembled people, and told them that his death was at hand ; on the following day, as his disease gained ground, he again assembled the people, and repeated his discourse, bidding them all fiurewell, and asking pardon of whomsoever he had offended. On the third day he summoned his £unny, and those to whom he was bound particularly to afford protection, and divided amongst them whatever appeared necessary to be distributed, to each one according to his deserts ; and, having arranged

The king of France, as if entertaining suspicion of this conference, proceeded at the time fixed to the place appointed, attended by a large army, which he had assembled for the purpose, and thus set dreadful and pernicious example to others, inasmuch as he went to discuss matters of peace in the same way as he would to attack his enemies. The king of England made reascmable excuses for not coming in person ; but sent a peaceful embassy, consisting of some of the chief men of the kingdom ; namely, Bichard earl of Cornwall, his brother, with some other nobles, fit to manage a conference, under the guidance of the venerable archbishop of York and the bishop of Ely, and other trustworthy persons seledted for the purpose. The bishop of Winchester, although selected before all others, absolutely refused to go, and, not without reason, gave the following as the cause for excusing himself : \" My lord king,\" said he,

But if your words were now placed with confidence in my mouth and in your letters, and should declare that I was a familiar and faithful Mend of yours ; all this would appear as contrary, and he would accuse both you and me of instability ; and this would blacken your feme in a great degree. Therefore, because it would be manifestly to your dishonour, I will not go on any account.\" And in the opinion of many, this reply gave sufficient excuse for him. When aU preparations had been made, and they were all ready to set sail on this journey, they were met by letters from the emperor, to say that he could not go to the conference then, as he had purposed ; but that what he could not do then, should, by God\'s fevour, be carried into effect on the Nativity of St. John the Baptist in the following year ; and thus each and all of them returned without effecting anything. In this year, on the day of the Supper, the bishop of Here-\* ford consecrated the holy unction in the church of St. Albans. About this time, too, John Scott, earl of Chester, closed his life about Whitsuntide, having been poisoned by the agency of his wife, the daughter of Llewellyn. The life of the bishop of Lincoln, too, was also attempted by the same means, and he was with difficulty recalled from the gates of death. In the same year, in the week before Whitsuntide, there fell storms of hail which exceeded the size of apples, killing the sheep ; and they were followed by continued rain.

In the same year, too, about the feast of St. Peter and St. Paul, it was not kiiDwn for what purpose, Master Otto, a cardinal deacon of St. Nicholas in the Tullian prison, came as legate to England on a summons from the king, unknown to the nobles ; at which a great many of them conceived great anger against the king, and said, \'\^ The king perverts all laws, breaks his faith and promises, and transgresses in everything he does ; he a little while ago united himself in marriage to a foreigne\"\^ without consulting his friends and natural sub 

It was said that Edmund, archbishop of Canterb\^, reproached the king for a«ting iii the way he did, and especially for summoning the legate, knowing that it would ere long be the cause of great loss to the kingdom, and to the prejudice of his dignity ; but the king rejected his advice, as well as that of others of his counsellors, and would on no account abandon the purpose he had conceived in his mind. The aforesaid legate, therefore, came in grand pomp and in great power, and the bishops axLd cler\^ of dStinction went% far\^ as the coa\^ to meet him ; and some went off to him in boats, receiving him with acclamations, and offering him costly presents. Even at Paris, the messengers of several bishops met him, and offered him cloth of scarlet and valuable cups. For doing this they deserved general censure, both for the gift and the manner of giving it ; for by the cloth and its colour it was made to appear that the office of the legateship and his arrival were accepted of. On his arrival, he did not receive all the presents offered to him, but only some ; and what he did not take, he ordered to be kept for him ; he then liberally distributed the vacant benefices amongst his followers, whom he had brought with him, whether deserving or undeserving. The king lumself met him at the seaside, and bowed his head to his knees ; after which he officiously conducted him to the interior of the country. The bishops also came, as well as abbats, and the other prelates of the churches, and received him with all honour and reverence, with processions and the music of bells, and with costly presents, as became them, and more than became them..

They were formerly all Christians, having been converted to the faith of Christ by the apostle St. Matthew, and the other apostles ; but afterwards the enemy sowed his tares amongst them, and they became for a long while darkened by a lamentable and wretched error, circumcising their children of both sexes, like the Saracens, therein not perceiving that the grace of baptism has rendered superfluous the circumcision of the flesh, in the same manner as the flowers droop and pine away on the advent of the fruit, of which the blessed apostle said to the Galatians, \" If ye be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing ;\" and again, \" I testify unto every man that is / circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law : Christ v is become of no effect to you ; whosoever of you are justified by the law, ye are fallen from grace.\" Another of their errors, not less than the abovementioned one, is, that they make confessions of their sins, not to the priests, but to Grod »/ alone, placing some lighted incense near them, as if their sins would rise before the Lord in the smoke. These wretches err through not understanding the Scriptures, and perish from a defect of learning ; they hide their wounds from spiritual physicians, whose business it is to distinguish be- y twoen one leprosy and another, and, after pondering on the \^\' circumstances of the crime, to enjoin repentsmce, and, according to the keys intrusted to them, to bind and loose, and specially pray for thpse who confess to them. Thus, in the Grospel, our Lord says to the lepers, \" Go show yourselves to the priests.\" Again, James says, \" Confess your faults one to another ;\" and Solomon says, \" Be not ashamed to confess your sins.\" Agaia, according to the Old Testament, the priest confessed the sins of the people on the head of the scapegoat : but how was he to confess their sins unless they were known, and had been confessed to him % Again, in the New Testament, in another part, St. Paul says to the Bomans, \" For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation :\" and of St. John the Baptist we read, \" They were baptized by him, confessing their sins :\" for, shame and a

Others of them mark their children in the form of a cross, on both cheeks, or on their foreheads, perversely thinking that they are purified by the fiery metal, because it is written in the Gospel of St. Matthew, that St. John the Baptist said of Christ, \" He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire.\*\* Since, / however, it is clear to all of the true faith, that the remiaV sion of sins is effected by spiritual fire, that is, the Holy Spirit, and not by visible fire ; hence the Lord, by his prophets, frequently reproves the children of Israel, denoimcing terrible curses against them, because, after the manner of heathens, they caused their children to pass through fire. In Deuteronomy he says, through his prophet Moses, \"Take heed that ye imitate not the abominations of those nations ; there shall not be any one among you who shall purify his son or his daughter by leading him through the fir«.\*\* And it is evident to all Christians, that neither our Lord, nor his apostles, nor any of the holy fathers, left this custom to be observed in the Church, nor did they order people to be burned in this way ; and we have seen the marks of burning in the arms of those who dwell amongst the Saracens, as well Jacobins as Syrians. They themselves offered to allow the sign of the cross to be impressed on them, to distinguish them from the pagans, and in their reverence for that holy symbol And when we inquired of the Greeks and Syrians why they detested the Jacobites, and had expelled them from their community, they stated, that the principal reason was, that they had fallen into a damnable and most wicked heresy, in declaring that there was only one nature and one person in Christ ; for heretics of this kind were excommunicated and condemned at the council of Chalcedon ; and some of them wickedly asserted that Christ, after assuming the form of

This erroneous doctrine was introduced by Eutyches, an abbat of Constantinople ; some, however, assert that, out of the two natures, there was only one in Christ. Two bishops of Alexandria, namely, Theodius and Gralan, were the originators of this error. It is, however, evident, that, in accordance with the nature of human beings, Jesus Christ hungered, thirsted, and endured other wants; he also suffered death on the cross ; but, in accordance with the nature of the Divinity, he brought the dead to life, and performed other good works, as he says concerning himself, \*\* Before Abraham was, I am ;\" and, \" I am the beginning, who am speaking to you ;\" again, he says, \" I and the Father are one.\" But, in reference to his nature as a man, he says, \" The Father is greater than I.\" And again, as to the cup passing away from him, he says, \" Not my will, but thine be done.\" Having made most diligent inquiries of the aforesaid Jacobins, as to whether they decl£u:ed that there was but one nature in Christ, they, I know not if through fear of confutation, or for some other reason, denied it. On my inquiring why they signed themselves with one finger, they replied, that they did so on account of the imity of the divine essence ; but in three places, to designate the Trinity : in signification of the holy Tiinity and Unity, they marked themselves in four places, in the shape of a cross. The Greeks and Syrians, however, were opposed to this, and, in signification of the Unity, which alone they believed to exist in Christ, they signed themselves with only one finger. Some of them used the Chaldaic character, and others the Arabic, which is called the Saracenic. Their laymen make use of different idioms, according to their different nations and provinces ; but the language of their clergy, which they use in divine writings, the lower orders do not understand ; for, although they use the Saracenic language, it does not resemble the vulgar Saracenic, but a sort of idiom peculiar to themselves, which the common people do not understand.

Pacification qf the nobles. In the first place, the said legate pacified some of the nobles, who, from some secret cause of dislike, were opposed to him, and by a kiss confirmed them in the faith. These were Peter bishop of Winchester, Hubert earl of Kent, Gilbert Bassett, Stephen Segrave, RichEurd Seward, and a great many others, who had been for a long time previously at enmity with him. And this hatred had almost come to a lamentable termination at a tournament held at Blith, at the beginning of Lent in this same year, at which the southern knights were opposed to those of the north, and the result was, that the southerners overcame their opponents, and some men of rank on the other side were taken, on which there ensued a regular conflict instead of a jousting-match ; and in this encounter Earl Bigod particularly distinguished himself amongst them all. After the legate had appeased the anger of these nobles, he wrote to all the prelates of England to meet him at London, in the octaves of St. Martin, in St. Paul\'s church, to hear the pope\'s warrant, granting and intrusting to him the full powers of the legate\^p, and at the same place to arrange plans for the reformation of the English church, and to hold council in his presence. The slaughter qfthe Knights of the Temple\^ near Damietta, About this time, lamentable rumours prevailed, spreading dismay throughout the Holy Land. At the death of the sultan of Aleppo, the truce made between the Knights Templars and the said sultan expired, when the Templars, wishing to enlarge their territories for the honour of Christ, made preparations for war, purposing to lay siege to a castle called Guascum, situated at the north side of Antioch, and pitched their camp in a grassy plain near the castle, appointing William of Montferrat, a native of Auvergne and preceptor of Antioch, as their chief When, however, they approached the said castle in battle-array, some captive Christians who were detained by the enemy in chains, together with some apostates, seeing their approach, cried out to them, \" ¥ty,

In the same year, about Michaelmas, the emj\^eror, having quelled the disturbances which had broken out in G\^ermany, and pacified all parties there, entered Italy in great force, with a determination by all means to punish the manifold injuries so often inflicted on him by the citizens of Milan. For when a short time before he returned into Grermany, at the time the internal disturbances took place, which the duke of Austria had excited to his own ruin, the Milanese, on hearing of it, as it were pursuing the emperor with inexorable hatred, cruelly murdered his followers, whom he had placed in the castles which he had gained possession of in Italy; thus daily provoking the emperor\'s anger. He, therefore, that he might not incur the charge of disobedience, often and with all humility, both by supplicatory letters and by several special messengers, entreated the pope himseli\^ as the head of the Church, to assist him in obtaining his inheritance, to punish the manifold injuries inflicted on him by the Milanese citizens, and to root out the sin of heresy fix)m every infamous city of Italy, especially as it was the duty of the church of Rome, if all others were silent, to oppose the insolence of all such people. The pope, however, on hearing this, dissembled and proceeded to Eome, as it were flying from before the emperor, being unwilling, or unable to assist him. The Eomans received him on his arrival with delight, fancying that he would not thenceforth as formerly go away from them ; for they found that during his absence, which had now lasted for ten years, they had incurred great loss of money. \^ The war between the emperor and the Milanese.

When therefore the emperor drew near with his large army, which was said to have exceeded a hundred thousand men, besides his Saracen mercenaries, and had proceeded to within a day\'s march of the place, the citizens, together with their allies, went forth without alarm, in great strength and in battle-array to meet him, pitching a camp till the day of battle should be determined, with a host of troops amounting to about sixty thousand men, and fixed their carrochium where the army seemed to be strongest. At sight of this the emperor summoned his counsellors, and encouraged them by the following .\^,\^c\^ \'\^ warlike speech ; --- \" See how these insolent Milanese, our \^ enemies, dare to appear against us, and presume to provoke me, their lord, to battle, enemies as they are to the truth and to the holy Church, and borne down by the weight of their sins. Cross the river \[for there was a river called the Oglio between them\], unftirl my banner, standard-bearer, and raise aloft my victorious eagle, and you, my knights, draw your formidable swords, which you have so often steeped in the blood of your enemies, and inflict your vengeance on these rats, who have dared this day to come forth from their holes to cope with the glittering spears of the Roman emperor.\" And no delay was allowed them, for the Milanese at once rushed on the imperial troops, and eagerly attacking the Saracens, who were the first opposed to them, in a short time slew them all, and following up their advantage, purposed committing a similar slaughter on the rest of the army opposed to them. On seeing this, the emperor, with his brave and invincible nobles, threw themselves in a body on the enemy, and exerting all their strength, repulsed their attacks, whilst the citizens, on the other hand, seeing that it was a matter of life and death, mutually exhorted each other to keep up their courage, and, attacking the enemy more courageously, they plunged their gUttering swords into their bodies, and converted the attack into a most bloody battle. Great numbers fell on both sides, and the air was filled with the shouts of the opposing troops, the groans of the dying, the clash of arms, the neighing of horses, and the cries of their riders urging them to speed, and the frequent hammering sound of thundering blows.

On hearing this, the emperor held a council, wisely and cautiously wishing to repress the fury of his enemies rather . than unadvisedly to continue the doubtful strussle, and to \^ commit himself and his wearied foUowers to the uncertain chances of war, for a dreadful slaughter of the nobles on both sides had taken place, to be lamented in after-ages ; but the Milanese got the worst of the battle, for the emperor made prisoners of three thousand men of rank belonging to the city, besides slaying a countless number of the common soldiers at the sword\'s point. Besides this he afterwards laid an ambuscade, and made prisoners of three hundred nobles, took their carrochium and their podesta, the son of the duke of Venice, who would rather have £illen in battle, and also slew many other nobles. Their bishop, too, either fell in battle or was taken prisoner ; and it is a certain fact that he left no one to give any account of him. Thenceforth, therefore, the emperor ordered all the roads and passes round the city to be strictly guarded, and obstructed the ingress and egress of merchants and husbandmen by posting guards day and night, broke the bridges, and gusoxled the ■ roads, in order, by these means, to weaken the strength and tame the lyildncis of his raging enemies.

Thus before the middle of Lent the emperor had taken forcible possession of all Italy, besides Bologna and four other cities, which had not the means of resistance ; the whole body of clerks at Bologna were in great alarm for themselves, because, in the past year, the emperor had told them to depart in peace, and they refiised to obey his commands. \\ V\^\^-\^ \^ The indignation qf the nobles of England against the king. \^\\. 0\^ Whilst these events were passing in the transalpine provinces. King Henry the Third, trusting to evil adviceTA contrary to what was his duty or expedient fcr him, Bstranged himself from the counsels of his natural subjects, and became stiff-necked against his well-wishers and those who looked to the advantage of the kingdom, and managed its affidrs but little or not at all according to their advice. In order to have some cunning pretexts for extorting(m\^\$\^om them, he declared on his oath, at a conference to which he had called the nobles from a distance, that he was entirely destitute of money and in a state of the greatest need ; he therefore most urgently begged of them to grant him the thirtieth part of property throughout the kingdom, that the dignity of Mm, the king, and that of the kingdom, might be supported in a more honourable manner, and be established on a firmer foundation. The nobles were greatly troubled at hearing this, and replied that theyjrere so often oppressed in this way, and saw so many (foreignire) fattening on their property, that the kingdom was weakened by poverty, and that manifold dangers were impending over it. However, after much discussion, inasmuch as the king humbled himself and promised that he would thenceforth abide by their counsels without hesitation, the thirtieth part of all moveable property was granted to him, though not without great difficulty. This he afterwards ordered to be collected and estimated, not at the royal valuation, but according to the common value, and not to be placed in coiivents and castles, as had been pre-arranged and determined on, nor to be expended at the discretion of the nobles; but without \'\^ taking the advice of s\^y one\^gf\^the natural subjects of his kingdom, he gave it tod\^reWe\^to be carried abroad, and;

He also stated the same with respect to abbacies\^ counties, baronies, wardships, and other escheats, and yet that the Hn\^s treasury, which ought to constitute the strength and dependence of the kingdom, had never felt any increase. Still, however, the king rejected his advice, as well as that of his other natural subjects, grew worse and worse in the madness he had conceived, and resigned himself so entirely to the will of the Romans, and especially the legate, whom he had unadvisedly sent for, that he appeared to worship his very footsteps ; for he also declared that he could not, either in public or private, arrange any business of the Hngdom, or make any alterations or alienations without the consent of his lord the pope, or the legate, so that he might be said to be not a king, but a vassal of the \^\' pope. By these and other similar ravings, the king now drew blood frt)m the hearts of his nobles ; and he also had as counsellors infamous and mistrusted men, who were said to foment these deeds of his, and who, consequently, were exceedingly hateful to the English nobles, although they derived their origin from the same kingdom ; and these were John, earl of Lincoln, S., earl of Leicester, and G., a brother of the Temple.

But the legate moderated the )man avaric§pand did not accept of all the presents offered him ; some, however, he received willingly, with a benign countenance, bearing in mind the philosophical remark of Plato, \" To receive all presents offered is greedy ; to receive none is contumacious ; but to accept some is friendly.\" 7%e king invites the count of Provence to visit him. The king in the mean time earnestly entreated the count of Provence, the queen\'s father, both by letter and repeated messages, to condescend to come to the land of his son-in-law, and to carry back some of his money with him on his return ; and it was believed by many that the king extorted the thirtieth part for the purpose of distributing it amongst him and other such people. The count, induced by the love of gain, quickly came at the summons, not being detained by any allurements or presents from the French, although the king had married his eldest daughter ; but before he reached the sea\^ internal war having been stirred up in the districts of Provence, he was recalled in all haste ; on hearing which, King Henry at once sent him a thousand marks to pay his travelling expenses, and to procure accoutrements in France. An interview at York between the kings of England and Scotland. In the same year, the king wrote to all his nobles to assemble in the presence of him and the legate, at York, on the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, to discuss some arduous matters connected with the kingdom ; the king of Scotland, too, had come to that place to meet them, having been invited by the king and the legate, to arrange terms for making peace between them, that by the grace of GU)d, all contentions between them might be set at rest, and each of them might be satisfied with receiving what jwas his due. On their arrival there, it was arranged that tJbe king of Scots should receive 300 librates \[15,600 acres\] of land in the kingdom of England, without permission to build a castle on it, / v/

On the legate\'s expressing a wish to go into the kingdom of Scotland, to examine into ecclesiastical affidrs there, as he had done in England, the Scotch king replied, \'\^ I do not remember ever to have seen a legate in my territories, nor that it has been necessary for one to be summoned there, thanks to Grod, and there is not now any need of one, for all goes on well; neither was any legate allowed ingress into that kingdom during the time of my father or any of my ancestors, and I will not allow it as long as I am able. However, since report pronoimces you to be a man of sanctity, I warn you, if you should happen to enter my territories, to proceed cautiously, lest anything untoward happen to you. For ungovernable, wild men dwell there, who thirst after human blood, and whom I myself cannot tame, and if they were to attack you, I should be unable to restrain them ; it is but lately, as you have perhaps heard, that they wanted to attack me and drive me from my kingdom.\" At hearing this, the legate moderated his eager desire to enter Scotland, and did not leave the side of his king, namely, the king of England, who obeyed him in everything ; but an Italian, a relation of the legate\'s, remained with the king of Scotland, whom the latter, that he might not seem entirely rebellious, honoured with knighthood, and conferred some land upon him. The council thus broke up, and the English king returned with the legate to the south. The grand preparations of the legate for holding a eouneil. As the time for holding a council drew near, the legate ordered a lofty and stately seat, supported on long planks, to be built for himself in the western part of St. Paul\'s church, at London. He then sent his letters to all the prelates of England, archbishops, bishops, abbats, and installed priors, ordering them to bring or send procuratorial letters of their convent or chapter, as well as in their own name, that what\* ever he, the legate, should determine on at the council, should

At this summons, all the prelates of England under the jurisdiction of his legateship came, although greatly harassed and fatigued in their own bodies, as well as those of their horses, because the winter was coming on, attended by very stormy weather. A heavy and destructive storm qfwind. Amongst others who came to that council, was one Master Walter Pruz, a clerk, who publicly declared that almost all the planets were then coining together under one sign of the zodiac, namely Capricorn, and would cause great commotion v iu the elemeats, and stir up heavy storms of wind ; and foretold that a great destruction of animals, especially homed ones (which we call flocks or herds), would ensue, and added, as if in jest, \" May it not be of homed men,\" that is, \" of bishops.\" This \^redicti\^\^of his was not altogether void of truth, for on a sudden, St. Paul\'s church, where they were all assembled, was suddenly shaken by such a storm of wind, that great fear seized on all, and especially the legate. On the night of St. CecDia\'s day, too, the moon being in its first quarter, extraordinary black clouds, of tower-like form, appeared in the western part of the heavens : thimder began toVoar, lightning to dart forth, and the ,dnd to rise, Ld throughout that whole night and the following day such a heavy storm of wind raged as was never remembered to have occurred before, and this storm continued for fifteen days more without interruption.

Although the prelates of England assembled at St. Patd\'s church, in London, on the first day appointed for holding the coundl, which was the day after the octaves of St. Martin, the legate did not appear, for the bishops had asked of him, that on that day means might be afibrded them of examining \^he arrangements he purposed making, and of deliberating on them, that no determination might be come to prejudicial to their interests. On the next day, some armed knights, «nd about two hundred soldiers, whom the king had, at his earnest entreaty, furnished him with, were placed in ambush.

However, on account of his station as key-bearer, and his being chief of the apostles, as well as his cathedral dignity, and the priority of his call, it would seem his image ought to have been placed on the right of the cross ; but as Paul believed in Christ, whom he had not seen, his image is placed on the right ; for \' Blessed are those who have not seen,\' k\^ Thus his grace the archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all England, and who presides over the most illu9

On the same day, too, at the request of the king, a certain privilege was read, concerning the celebration of the feasts of St. Edward throughout England, and, by command of the pope, another concerning those of the canonized saints Francis and Dominic.

Since, therefore, great numbers are concerned in this question, we beg of your holiness, for your own safety, as well as our own, to consult the pope ere coming to a determination of this kind ; besides, since your decree as to the religious order of St Benedict extends itself in a like degree to all, and it would be difficult for a great many, on account of the poverty of their houses, and especially for nuns, as they are weak and frail, to observe this decree, it is necessary to diow discreet moderation in the enforcement of this rigorous measure, and we, therefore, beg of you, in this matter also, to consult his holiness the pope.\" In reply to him, the legate said that, if all the prelates, namely, the archbishops and bishops present before him, would write to the pope on these matters, he would agree to it willingly. And it should be known that, because some people thought, as had been given them to understand by the legate, that his decrees would only be confirmed during the time of his legateship, Master Atho, one of his clerks, at his bidding, rose in the midst of the assembly, and, opening a book of warrants, which was the register of his holiness the pope, to increase his authority, and the more effectually to do away with this opinion, read aloud a certain decretal, which the legate distinctly proved the truth o\^ and by which he plainly showed that, even after the said legate\'s departure, his statutes would be lastingly confirmed. It also should not be omitted, that on the first day of the council, the archbishops of Canterbury and York, having taken their places, as before stated, the former on the right, and the latter on the left of the legate, and after the Gospel, \"I am the good shepherd,\" had been read, and the Collects appertaining to it, silence was enjoined, and, the assembled crowd having been called to order, the legate, from his seat, raised his voice, as it were a trumpet, and commenced his discourse, preceding it by the

CommencetMnU of the council held in St. Paul\'s church, at London, by the legate Otto, \" Since holiness becomes the house of the Lord and his ministers, it is said by the Lord, \* Be ye holy, for I, the Lord your God, am holy.\' The cunning of the enemy of mankind is endeavouring to diminish holiness, or to destroy it altogether ; so that in many places he hinders churches from being consecrated, and the ministers from discharging their duties properly, by corrupting and vitiating their morals and lives, in opposition to the rules and statutes of the holy fathers, and obstructing everything which is to the advantage of the Christian religion. This should, therefore, in all feith be resisted with a strong hand by all true Christians ; and to weaken its endeavours, fr\^sh and renewed strength should be employed, like as Isaac first endeavoured to renew the wells which the sons of Abraham had dug, but which the men oi Palestine had filled up with earth, and then dug other new ones.

Moreover, as we have seen ourselves, and have heard &om many, that such a wholesome service is despised, or at least neglected by some, since we find that many churches and even cathedrals, which have been built of old, have not yet been consecrated with the oil of sanctification ; we, therefore, wishing to put a stop to this negligence, decree and enjoin, that all cathedral, conventual, and parochial churches, which have been built and completed, shall, within the space of two years, be consecrated by the diocesan bishops in whose jurisdiction they are, or by some other persons under authority from them ; and in this manner within the same period, it shall be done with all churches to be rebuilt anew. And in order that this wholesome decree may not fall into contempt, we decree that, if any churches shall not have been dedicated within two years from the time of their completion, they shall be interdicted from the performance of mass till they are consecrated, unless any reasonable excuse can be alleged. In addition to this, we by the present decree strictly forbid all abbats and rectors of churches to presume to destroy the old consecrated churches under pretence of building more beautiful or larger ones, without permission and consent of the diocesan bishop ; and the diocesan should carefully consider whether it would be expedient to give or refuse permission ; if he give permission, he must give his attention and use his endeavours to have the work completed as soon as possible ; which condition we decree shall be extended to those already begun.

Baptism, Confirmation, Penance, the Eucharist, Extreme tJnction, Marriage, and Ordination, each of which is fully treated of and ordained in the sacred canons. But as it is no light matter for a physician to be ignorant of the business of healing, we decree that, in receiving the cure of souls and the priesthood, candidates shall be examined on these points especially ; and the arc\^i deacons at the meetings of their deaneries should chiefly endeavour to instruct the priests on these matters, teaching them how to act with respect to Baptism, Penance, the Eucharist, and Marriage.\" Of baptism, \'\* For the solemn (\^lebration of baptist two Saturdays are appointed by the holy canons for its solemnization, namely, \\\^ the Saturday before the Lord\'s resurrection, and the Saturday before Whitsuntide ; but some, as we have heard, in these parts, have been led astray by the deceit of the devil, and fear danger if children are baptized on those days ; but to think tins, or to be afraid of either of these days, is entirely opposed to the true faith, and is proved to be evidently false, since the supreme pontiff personaUy performs that solemnity, and solemnly baptizes children on the said days ; and the Church observes the same in other parts of the world. Wherefore, we decree that the people be converted from this great error by frequent preachings, and be induced to perform the ceremony of baptism, and to baptize their children on the abovenamed days. We also decree that parochial priests correctly leam\^he form of baptism, and frequently explain it in public to their parishioners on Sundays ; so that, if necessity should arise for them to baptize any one, they may know it, and be able to observe it ; and let them afterwards diligently inquire whether it has been observed.\"

iLD. 1237.\] HOW CHURCHES ABE TO BE FABMED OUT. 79 Of farms and viearships of the churches. \" The farming of churches, or the general appointment of a vicar in them, we by no means wish to be supported by our authority ; but in consequence of the weakness of the ntmibers concerned in this matter, we fear to issue a prohibitory edict against these things, lest we may seem to throw out snares rather than to find remedies. But to some customs arismg from these matters, and which have been brought to our notice, we are compelled to apply a remedy. For it very often happens that those who are called farmers, wishing to gain more than to pay, practise base extortions, which sometimes even sink into the sin of simony. Wherefore, we henceforth strictly forbid the putting out to farm of dignities or offices of deaconries, or the revenues arising &om the exercise of the ecclesiastical or spiritual jurisdiction, from penance or the altar, or from any other sacraments.\" How churches are to be farmed out, \" Since it is altogether improper for churches to be farmed by laymen and by any clerks for a long time, and might be injurious to the churches on account of its long continuance, which usually causes danger, we strictly forbid the churches to be farmed for more than five years, either by laymen or even by ecclesiastical persons, nor, when the five years are ended, shall they be renewed to the same persons, unless some other persons shall have held them in the intermediate time, and, that all things may be safe, we decree that the agreement for farming shall be made in the presence of the bishops or archdeacons, and several copies of the same shall be made, one of which shall be left in their possession.\" Concerning the same, \"We have heard that it has sometimes happened, that when a rich church is vacant, which some one wished to have, but did not dare, however, to receive it in his own name, lest he should be deprived of the other benefices which he held, has cunningly managed that that church should be farmed \^o him perpetually, so that he would pay some small sum for it to another under the name of the parson, and keep all the rest to himsel£ On which account, we, by an edict, decree\^ that whether a benefice be given, either wholly or in part, to

And thus that fraud is avoided, by which, oftentimes, on payment of a small sum to any one under the name of parson, the church was given to him under the feigned name of vicar, who, dreading to lose his other benefices, was afraid to receive it in person. With respect to the vicars already appointed, who are not priests, inasmuch as vicars are bound to serve parsons and churches, we enjoin and decree that they cause themselves to be ordained as priests within a year at furthest. Otherwise, if it be their f&vlt that they are not ordained within the year as we have stated, we decree that they shall be deprived of their benefices from that time, and the question of their residence shall be determined according to what we have above laid down concerning institutions.\" 27ie church of an absentee is not inconsiderately to be given to another, \"To destroy the deceits of the wicked, every lover of justice must employ sagacious endeavours, lest, if the industry of their rulers should grow torpid, simplicity be supplanted by cunning, and truth peld to Msehood ; for we have learnt by the statements of many persons that some people, casting a longing eye on the benefice of an absent person, spread reports declaring that they have heard that the possessor was dead, or had resigned his benefice, and thus manage, by some means or other, to intrude themselves into that benefice, and if the dead man should revive and return to his church, t\\\^ answer is made him : \* I know you not, brother ;\' and the door is shut against him.

We, therefore, applying 6ach remedies as are in our power, in both cases, strictly forbid the benefice of any absent man, under pretence of conjecture or report, which may be given out concerning his death, or of his giving up his benefice, to be given to any other person ; but the prelate shall wait till he is fully informed of the truth of either report. Otherwise we decree that he shall be bound to make good all the loss suffered by the absent person owing to this matter ; and that the person who has intnided himself in the benefice, shall be forthwith ipso /acto suspended from all office and benefice, besides makmg restitution of the property. And this we mean also to extend to the case of any one who, when another possesses an ecclesiastical benefice, presumes, on his own authority, or rather by force, or by stealth, to seize upon that benefice, or who, after it has been declared to belong to another, endeavours to defend himself in the possession of it by force of arms.\" That one church it not to be divided into several vicarages, \" Since the art of all arts, as witness St. Gregory, is the government of souls, the ancient sophist never ceases to practise the stratagems of his deceitftd art, and to study the fallacies of false pretences, so as to be able to surround with the principles of his art, and to shut out from salvation those whom he finds ignorant or unwary. It is this that makes them transgress the commands of God and opppse the rules of the holy fethers, whilst neither divine discourse nor canonical decrees can recall the sinners from their crooked path. Now our catholic art demands that there be only one master in one church, who shall be perfect in order, demeanour, life, knowledge, and doctrines, and that the administration of the church should be pure and simple. The opposition of the devil, however, causes many to deviate from this decree, inasmuch as sometimes, at his suggestion, one church is given not to one only, but to several, under pretence of having a great number of patrons, so that there are several heads to one body, and it seems as it were a monster. And sometimes the parson consents, whatever the VOL. I. G

And if, perhaps, the parson should stay there, he is not so perfect in his order, since he is not a priest, nor in his manners ; since if he were seen by any one, he would be thought not a clerk, but rather a soldier ; and he takes little care, alas ! about his life, knowledge, or doctrines ! The arrangement of the church, too, is rarely made by the simple eye as it ought; for the felse machinations of the devil\'s art are not wanting there. For sometimes, as we have heard, a church is given secretly to some one, expressly on condition that he who institutes or presents should retain some benefit in it, or some other person should receive some portion from it, who would perhaps have retained it all if he had not refrained horn. doing so through the weakness of his cause, or through fear of losing other benefices. Sometimes, also, a man will resign a parsonage, and afterwards take the vicarage from one who has been installed in it, which we may presume is done not without fraud. We, therefore, reprobating these diminutions, and especial assignments and changes, aa contrary to our profession, forbid them from henceforth being made, and strictly decree that never for the future shall one church be divided into several parsonages or vicarages. And those which have been divided up to this time, shall, as soon as the means of so doing are afforded, be made entire, unless, perhaps, it be a church so instituted from times of old, where the bishop has to take care that the revenue and the parish be equally divided between them. The diocesans also shall arrange that there shall be always some one residing at the church who shall be anxious in his attention to the cure of souls, and shall employ himself usefiilly and honourably in, the performance of divine service, and in the administering of the sacraments.\" Of residing in the churches.

We also say and think the same in all respects with regard to those who presume, without a special (fispensation of the Apostolic See, to detain several dignities, parsonages, or benefices connected with the cure of souls, in opposition to a statute of the general coimcil, and to the peril of their own salvation.\" The dress of clerks. \" Whereas, with regard to the dress of the clerks, which \^\\(3 appears to be not clerical, but rather military, a great scandal \^\^\^\" has arisen amongst the laity, we strictly order and decree, that they shall, under penalty of a deprivation of their benefices, be restricted by the bishops to the form determined on in the general council, respecting the dress of the clergy as well as the ornaments of their horses, so that those who have undertaken the charge of churches and the cure of souls, may wear garments of becoming measure, and shall wear close hoods when appointed to holy orders, especially in their church, before their prelates, at the assemblies of the clergy, and everywhere in their parishes. And that the bishops may be better enabled to restrict others to a propriety of dress, and to a becoming tonsure, and also to proper ornaments for their horses, they shall see that these things are previously observed by their fellow clerks, following the rule of clerical propriety in their garments, spurs, bridles, and saddles.\" Against the contracting of clandestine marriages by the rectors qf the churches, \" It has been brought to our notice by several credible persons, that many of the clergy, unmindful of theii\* own salvation, having contracted clandestine marriages, dare to retain possession of the churches after marriage, to acquire ecclesiastical benefices, and to be promoted afresh to holy orders, in opposition to the decrees of the holy canons. Afterwards, in course of time, it seems to be expedient for the offspring begotten by this marriage, whether the parties themselves are alive or dead, to prove, either by witnesses or by instruments in writing, that such a marriage has been contracted. But because, owing to the clergy being occupied with q2

And if any property shall have been acquired after a marriage of this kind, in whatsoever manner obtained, either by l\^emselves or by means of other persons, from their property, . the same shall not, on any account, be applied for the use of the wives or children of such a marriage, but be forthwith devoted to the churches which they held, or in which they held benefices.

Hence, it happens that, as two of them bear witness that they have summoned him, he is excommunicated according to the tenour of the sentence and the custom of the district, or is suspended as contumacious, though he was altogether innocent of contumacy, as he was ignorant of the summons. \"We, therefore, in our zeal for justice, to correct this detestable abuse, and other similar ones, decree, that henceforth, in ecclesiastical causes in the kingdom of England, summonses shall not be sent by those who apply for them, or their messengers ; but the judge, at a moderate cost to the applicant, shall send them by a trustworthy messenger of hiis own, who shall diligently seek out the party to be summoned ; and if the messenger is unable to find him, he shall cause the letters of summons to be read and published, in the church of the place where the summoned party usually resides, on Sunday, or some other holy day, when mass is performed : or, at least the summons shall be sent to the dean in whose deanery the summoned party resides, who, on

For, as we have heard, the warrants are written and signed, not only by inferior clerks, but also by prelates ; in wHch warrants Wnifest care is taken to show that they had procured some one to be present at the contract or matter in hand, or that some one summoned to trial should appear, or that letters of citation had been presented to him, who had never been present, or even found, and who perhaps at the time was living in another diocese or province. Also, as letters of this kind plainly contain falsehoods, we strictly forbid these or any similar things to be done; and, after careful deliberation, we establish a decree, that those who may be convicted of this offence, or who presume to persevere in issuing such warrants, shall suffer the punishment due to forgers and those using false instruments.\" Of the Persons who ought to hold authentic seals. « As pubHc notaries are not in practice in England, on which account it is necessary that more credit be given to authentic seals, we decree that not only archbishops and bishops, but also their officials, shall hold seals, in order that their assistance may be obtained more easily. Also, all abbats, priors, deans, archdeacons, and their officials, rural deans, and also chapters of cathedral churches, and other conventual assemblies, together with their rectors, or separately, according to their custom or statutes, according to the variety of each of the aforesaid, shall have each his own seal ; that is to say, the name of his rank, office, and college, and also the name of those who enjoy the honour of perpetual rank or office, inscribed in plain characters thereon, and shall thus hold an authentic seal.

With regard to the custody of the seals, we order great care to be taken ; namely, each person shall keep his own himself, or shall deliver it to only one person, in whom he can place confidence, to be kept by him : and he shall swear to keep it faithfully, and that he will not \^ anything with it for any one from which anything prejudicial could arise, unless what his lord had read and carefully examined, and then ordered to be so sealed. In granting the use of the seal, faithful and circumspect caution should be observed ; faithful, that it may be easily granted to those who require it, and circumspect, that it may be denied to Mse and fraudulent persons. We also decree, that at the beginning, and also the end of each authentic writing, there shall be a proper insertion of the day, time, and place.\" The oath to be taken by advocates, \" We have heard the cry of justice, complaining that it is greatly impeded by the quibbles and cunning of advocates, and that it is very often denied by unskilftil judges, through ignorance, whom the parties often deceive by their contumacy. For it sometimes happens that a person who is put into possession for the sake of keeping property, endeavours to retain possession, although the opposing party returns within the year, and is prepared to satisfy justice in everything. Sometimes, too, the person who is sent to take possession is not able, although he be adjudged to be the true possessor, to gain possession either within a year, or afterwards, the opposite party resisting by force of arms. We, therefore, rising to the assistance of justice, do, with the approbation of the council, decree, that whoever wishes to obtain the office of advocate shall make oath to the diocesan in whose jurisdiction he lives,\' that in cases in which he may plead, he will plead faithfully, not to delay justice, or to deprive the other party of it ; but to defend his client both according to law and reason.

Letters from the Emperor to Earl Richardf iitforming him qf his victory over the Milanese. In the same year, just before Christmas, that mighty conqueror of his enemies, the Roman emperor Frederick, sent imperial letters, sealed with gold, as was his custom, to Richard, earl of Cornwall, to inform him, and others through him, of the victory granted to him by Heaven over the 3Mttlanese, as mentioned above ; the purport of which letter was as follows :--- \" Frederick, hy the grace of God, emperor of the RonvamSy ever Augy\^tv\^, king of Jerusal&in a/nd Sicily, to Richa/rd, ea/rl of Cornwall, his beloved brother-in-law, IieaUh amd sincere affection. --- How audacious and rash have been the proceedings of the ligurians \[Genoese\] in rebelling against our royal person, experience and the proximity of the place has informed neighbouring people, and the report of inveterate wickedness has carried the news to people at a distance. And we think that you are not unaware of what the world knows, namely, that our constant system of passing over their offences has continued so long, that, if we were to do so any further, our endurance would lose the name of true patience, and would incur the stigma of vile pusillanimity, Lstead of the honourable name of virtue. Considering; then, after some little time, that wounds which do not feel any effect from the application of fomentations, ought to be cut with the knife, we of necessity resorted to mns, arouang the sleeping empire from its lethargy ; but we could not, either in the past year, or during the present one, induce our rebellious subjects to incur the risk of giving us open battle, that we might at once gain a victory over them. By a fortunate chance, however, it happened that the Milanese with their allies were summoned to garrison Brescia, and thus a river was interposed between us and them, by which they were surroundec\^ as it were, by a rampart ; on this we pitched our camp on the other side of the river Oglio ; but here the £uthful knights and people of the cities returned home, not being able any longer to endure the tediousness

The Milanese and their allies, not being able to stay any longer in their hiding-places, owing to the scarcity of necessaries, crossed the river Oglio by the fords and bridges, and came into the open plain, thinking to escape from us by a secret flight, and perhaps not imagining that we were so near. When, however, they knew of our proximity, fear and terror fell on them like a clap of thunder from heaven, and at sight of the advanced guard of our imperial army, even before they could see the victorious standards, the imperial eagles, they turned to flight before us in such confusion, that, till they reached their carrochium, which they had sent forward to Nuova Croce, as fast as horses could carry it, not one of our pursuing troops could gain sight of the faces of the fugitives, and, as we believed that it was necessary for us to hasten to the assistance of the auxiliary troops, who had proceeded in advance in a small body, we marched forward after them with all speed with the strength of our army, and when we expected to find them repelled by the attacks of the fighting enemy, we found our progress impeded by the numbers of horses which were running hither and thither without riders, and by the multitude of knights lying wounded or slain ; whilst those who were alive were either standing or lying on the earth, having been bound by the esquires of the knights, who followed their lords. At length we discovered their carrochium, near the walls of Nuova Croce, surrounded by trenches, and protected by an immense body of knights, and ftll their foot soldiers, who fought wonderftdly in its defence ; we then directed our attention to the attack and capture of this standard, and we saw that some of our troops, after having forced their way over the top of the trenches, had, with commendable bravery, forced their way almost up to the pole of the carrochium.

It is well for you that you are removed from these troubles, that you have gone to a distant country, so as not to see the sufferings of your people and the saints, to be beaten by daily blows, to be lacerated with frequent prickings. We wished, as we have often tried to do, to reform the condition of the Church, into which a shapeless state of desolation has crept : counsel is administered in vain, where the wish is not restrained by the curb of prudence, but, excited by its violence, it rushes forward to a declivity, and cannot be stopped. In addition to the mass of our other sorrows, that noble pillar which used so nobly to support the fabric of the Church, our lord the bishop of Sabina, of cherished memory, has been suddenly taken away from amongst us ; at first, he was struck with grief at our trouble, and afterwards attacked by a slow disease, and died to enter into the power of the Lord, leaving a lamentable scene of ruin to his mother.

At sight of such wickedness and oppression, the Greek church rose against that of Rome, expelled their emperor, and showed obedience only to their archbishop of Constantinople, named German, who, in his ravings, strayed from the CathoUc faith, and boldly defended the erroneous doctrines of the Greeks, as well the old errors as others newly invented. Their foolish creed is as follows : --- They assert that the Holy Spirit proceeds not from the Son, but from the Father alone, because it is found in the Scriptures written, \*\* The spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father.\" Moreover, they consecrate the eucharist from fermented bread. In many points, too, they contradict the Latins, and despise them, condemning the Roman church in several points, more, however, regarding its acts than its sayings. He has, therefore, like another Lucifer, established Ids see in the north, that is to say, at Constantinople, the metropolitan city of the Greeks, a degenerate son and an antipope, calling it his church, and declaring that it is the most worthy ; he also says that the Roman church is its sister, not its mother, because St. Peter, the chief of the apostles, in former times established a cathedral see at Antioch, which is adjacent and belongs to the Greek empire, before he came to Rome ; he adds also, that Antioch showed all the honour and reverence in its power to the apostle of Christ, and in this way to Christ, on which account it was honoured with the name of \" Theophilus ;\" whilst Rome, after many insults and much contumely, condemned the said Peter and his fellow apostle Paul to death. Thus, on the side of the Greeks, was honour and reverence shown, whilst on that of the Romans, disrespect and insolence was offered ; wherefore, the Greeks, by right, deserved to be called the sons, and the Romans the stepsons. However, as is to be gathered from the tenour of the undermentioned letters, the said Archbishop German VOL. L n

For I have learned by thy prophet Isaiah, that every one who believeth in thee as being this stone shall in no way be confounded, nor can he be moved from the foundation of his hope ; and this is the truth, and no one dares to contradict it, unless he be a disciple of th« Jather of lies.

Joseph was sold into i\^ypt for silver, after having been let down into the pit, and was afterwards thrown into prison, and the events which followed, how glorious and how honourable they were, and how God was glorified in the midst thereof are well known to the wise understanding of thy mind, most holy &ther. To what this discourse refers, and the meaning of it, the brothers who are present, whose number is equal to that of the wise virgins, and whom a dangerous meeting and an unjust imprisonment have brought to our noticf, will explain to your holiness. The lamp of their works, with the light which emanates from it, shines before men to the glory of the heavenly Father, and they wisely always supply it with the oil of good works, that its light may not be extinguished, and they themselves may not be drawn into sloth, and thus be refused admission to the kinctdom. They are all without staves and slippers, and each of them has his own particular garments. Now I think, according to the apostle, that their feet are beautifrd, as they are preaching the gospel of peace between the Greeks and Latins, and they may briefly be caUed, as if without any burden, most 4nbl\^ and Lift runners, hastening to God, who is the goal of all good men ; on their attaining which, they will cease running, and receive their much-desired\^xeaiard.

This, as I believe, David also, in his lamentations, says in the book of Psalms, \* They have been separated and not held compunction.\' But if we were to feel compunction, we should grieve and be sorrowful ; and if we were to meet with trouble and grief, we should call upon the name of the Lord ; and as long as we sought him, he would come to our assistance, as if in the midst of his disciples, pacifying those at variance, and correcting the discordance of their thoughts.

What then \^hall I say more 1 Let us shake off all other care and anxiety from our minds like dust from off our feet, and let us use all our endeavours to discover whom this two-edged and terrible sword touches, and who those are whom it separates from their union with the limbs of the Church, of which Christ is •the head. If it touches us Greeks, show us the incision, wash away the blood from the wound, apply the spiritual plaster, bandage it up, and preserve your brethren who are in this danger, lest they perish, and thus agree with Solomon, who gives this proverb : \* A brother is proved in difficulties.\' Let us, however, chiefly listen to the Lord himself, who gave wisdom to this said Solomon, and who says through the prophet, \* Whoever separates the valuable from the cheap, shall be as it were my bone.\' But if we Greeks are without a scar, and free from a wound by this sword of the anathema, and it is drawn against the Italians and Latins, and is raised for the purpose of slaying and destroying some, we think that you will not, through ignorance or a wicked pertinacity, suffer yourselves to be separated from the side of the Lord, for whom each of you would willingly endure ten thousand deaths, if it were possible.

One thing, as we believ\^ which has been long ago prescribed to the Greeks from above, has till now been wanting, namely, the time of martyrdom ; but the time is now at hand for the cruel tribunal to be opened, and the seals of torments to be put forward, for deluges of blood to flow, and for us to descend to the arena of martyrdom, and fight the good fight, that we may receive crowns of glory from the right hand of the Almighty. The famous island of Cyprus knows what I say is true; she knows, and has produced new mart3rrs, and seen the soldiers of Christ, who first crossed the sea, and, being cleansed in a bath of tears, and by sweat, at last even passed through fire, and were led by God, who viewed their struggles, into the heavenly resting-place. Are these things good, most holy pope, successor of the apostle St. Peter ? Does Peter, the gentle and humble disciple of Christ, enjoin such things 1 Does he thus instruct the elders when he writes, \* The elders which are amongst you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory which shall be revealed?

We are not ignorant, most holy father, that in the same way as we Greeks endeavour to observe orthodox and pious doctrines in everything, so as not in any way to stray from the statutes of the apostles and holy fathers, so the church of old Eome, as we well know, strives on its own behalf to think that it is not deceived in any point, and asserts that it wants neither remedy nor correction ; and this we know is said in the church of the Greeks as well as in that of the Latins : for no one can ever see anything ugly in his own face, unless he looks into a looking-glass, or is informed by some other person how he . rj \^ looks in the face, whether ugly or otherwise.

For if a man who acts without counsel opposes himself, as Solomon with truth says ; therefore, on the other hand, whoever has much and good advice draws his friends to him with great affection, and even allures his enemies into friendship with him. That this is a divine and heavenly plan, the prophet Isaiah bears witness, where he calls the consubstantial word of the Father, and the great angel of wisdom, the admirable counsellor, that it may be understood, forsooth, how necessary it is in matters concerning the Lord to distinguish the difference of persons. For, according to the nature of the Divinity, there is one will x)f the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit ; therefore much honour accrues to the advisers of good things, because from this they obtain a name in common with the Lord, if they shall give counsel for human salvation according to what is acceptable to him.

The separation of o\^(\^\\\^ x\\ our union arose from your tyranny and oppression, and from \>\^ . the exactions of the Koman church, which, instead of a mother became a stepmother, and, like a rapacious bird driving away from her its young, drove her sons away from her ; and the more humble and prone to obedience they are, the more she tramples on them, and the more vile she considers them, not heeding the saying of the Grospel, that \* Whoever humbleth himself shall be exalted.\' Let moderation, therefore, restrain you ; and although the Eoman avarice is innately settled in you for a short time, let us descend to a scrutiny of the truth, and, after having made a strict examinatiofi intp it,,\^g\^regards both sides of the question, let us return to a fiimunion); for we aJOi, Greeks and Latins, were som5\~ttl5e\'\~fflnce\~br the fseune faith, observing the same canonical mles, in the enjoyment of peace amongst ourselves, lighting each for the other, and putting the enemies of the Church to confusion.

And when Rome had been often taken possession of by other nations, the Greek empire freed it from their tjo\^anny : Agapetus and Vigilius, too, fled for a time to Constantinople, owing to the dissensions at Rome, and were honourably received and protected ; although you never afforded an asylum or lent assistance to us when placed in a situation of difficulty ; however, it is our duty to act well even to the ungrateful ; for the seas are calmed for pirates, and God makes the sun to rise on the just and the_unjust.

But as we ought piously to believe, a resistance of this kind was not the cause of any discord or bitter contention, but rather of examination and profound arguments arousing temporal condescension. For they were united in Christ by the bonds of affection, of similar Mth and doctrines, and not distracted by any ambition or avarice; and would that in these respects .xf\^ we were like them. But it has given rise to offence in our minds, that you gape after earthly possessions whencesoever you can scrape them together, and 6bllect gold and silve and yet you say that you are dLsciples of him who says, \* I have neither gold nor silver with me ;\' you compel kingdoms to be tributary to you ; you (Multiply moneSby traflSc ; you unteach by your acts what you preach with joui\* mouth : let moderation restrain you, that you may be an example to us as well as to the whole world.

If I did not reverence the great apostle Peter, who is the head of the apostles of Christ, and the rock of the faith, I would bring to your memory how this rock was shaken to its foundation, and agitated by a low woman, with Christ\'s permission, according to the judgments by which he foresees all things, whose judgments are a great deep ; who by the sound of the cock crowing, brought to Peter\'s memory the words of the prophecy, and aroused him from the sleep of despair.

Although, as the contents of your letter recalled to our recollection, Christ is the first and chief foundation of the faith, which we acknowledge, beyond which no other can be laid ; yet in the second place, and as the secondary foundation, we will mention the apostles and prophets, and the foundations of Sion in the holy mountains; and the citizens of heavenly Jerusalem are said to have been established on the foundations of the apostles and prophets. Amongst these the first and chief is the blessed Peter, not without reason, and by a special prerogative he was allowed to hear from the Lord, \* Thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation a stone.\' As the full force of bodily sense is concentred into the head, from which by some secret passages a portion flows into each of the limbs, like a rivulet from a fountain, so the three orders of those of the feith, Noah, Daniel, and Job, that is to say, prelates, both monks and married persons, whom Ezekiel is said to have seen in his vision as persons to be saved. By Peter is designated the rock on which the Lord has built --- not a house of the wood of Mount Lebanon, nor a gallery of pillars, nor a house of the daughter of Pharaoh, but his church for his feithful people, who are caught in its net, as it were\^om the whole body of fishes of all kinds. He is, as it were, the primate of primates, who drank streams from the fountains of our Lord\'s intelligence, whence the means of salvation must be derived, and with all patience and teaching, not contentiously nor by proud resistance, must the darkness of error be removed. And what you state does not oppose this, if you make a distinction of time and place, that Paul withstood Peter to his face ; since we may read that this has been done by orthodox Others ; and Peter, by professing the Mosaic law, endeavoured to gain the Jews, and Paul, shunning circumcision by all the means in his power, strove to gain the Gentiles from this felse doctrine. Otherwise it may be argued that Paul, when travelling through Syria and Cilicia, having arrived at Derbe and Lystra, circumcised Timothy, who was sprung from a Gentile father, and by a widow of the true feitL La the second and thu-d place, the argument may be adduced that, when Paul sailed to Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila, and had shaved his head

For, although Peter and Paul carried on their labours in different languages and by different rites, supplying milk to the children and meat to those of more advanced age, the former amongst the stiffs necked people of Judsea, and the latter amongst the Crentiles, yet, when the fail term was expired, each of the two with one and the same spirit, preached one Lord, one £Edth, one bc\^ tism, and the other articles of fidth, according to the grace bestowed on him by God. For according to the words of the Lord, who spoke to Peter and the rest of the apostles in these words; \'Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.\' Paul was, in conjunction with Peter, performing the mysteries of his office, and according to these words of the same authority, expressed to Peter in particular, \' Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven ; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven !\' he thus recognised Peter\'s dignity. He therefore came to him as the chief and the foimtain of the Gospel of the Lord at Jerusalem, and afterwards, in conjunction with him and others, preached the Grospel according to the revelation, that \* he might not have run in vain ;\' and this same circumstance is confirmed by the words of our Lord, spoken to Peter alone, in which he is enjoined, \' If his brother sinned against him, to forgive him, not only seven times, but seventy times seven ;\' to him alone, too, the Lord distinctly intrusted his sheep, and he possessed such a special virtue in performing miracles, that sick men were placed on their couches and beds in the streets, and were healed by his shadow.

An there is one God, one faith, one baptism, one beginning, one body of the church militant, and a body with many heads is considered prodigious, and one without a head is without a beginning, it only remains for the government of the Church universal, which the said Peter, in conjunction with Paul, lias assembled from amongst the Greeks, Latins, and barbarians, that the Lord should, by what has been before stated, appoint a chief of it, and show who is to succeed him. He, however, foreseeing that the Church would be trampled on by tyrants, lacerated by heretics, and separated by schisms, said to him : \* I have prayed for thee, Peter, that thy faith £sdl not ; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren :\* from which it is plainly to be inferred that all ques\^ tions of Mth ought to be referred to the see of Peter. But, to use the words of your own letter, and we say it with sorrow, the long and seamless vestment of the true Joseph has indeed been presumptuously torn, not by the hands of soldiers, but by the passions of ecclesiastical persons; and, therefore, let us see who has torn it. Inasmuch as the Greek church seceded fix)m the imity of the Koman see, it immediately forfeited its privilege of ecclesiastical liberty ; and she who had been formerly free, became a slave of the secular power, that by a just dispensation of God, she who would tiot recognise in Peter the divine primateship, might endure secular rule, however unwillingly; under which, despising things of no sUght importance, backsliding by degrees, professing a meaningless faith, and waxing cold in its brotherly affection, rushed back through the field of licentiousness ; so that, without rebuke from any one, it concealed what was lawfrd imder what was unlawful; and, seceding fix\>m the temple of Peter, is, as it were, ejected by the Lord from his hall, which John, in accordance with the Lord\'s prohibition, does not measure out with his staff, since it is given to the Gentiles, as you see visibly brought to completion.

But if the church of the Greeks considers that \^e has the authority of Paul, let her show it, or recognise him when shown with Peter, by the successor of Peter, and the vicar of Jesus Christ, in the church of the apostles, built by Constantine. It has also denoted the mystery of his office, although, in your letter it is mentioned as a cause of reproach, that Peter was thrice aroused and awoke at the crowing of the cock, and was made the porter of paradise, in order that he, who was to have command, might know how to suffer and to sympathize, and by virtue of his authority, thrice repeated, \* Feed thou,\' not \*Feed ye, my sheep,\' --- \^not the sheep of others, --- \^he might transmit to his successor the example of the true shepherd, and the spirit of lenity, correct the excesses of the people, returning to the imity of the Church ; deliver to Satan those that wander, and bring back the sheep, however unwilling, to the true fold. But if, from compassion, you return like a true Israelite to the primate of the Apostolic See ; and if your bowels are moved by contrition for the rending of the seamless garment of Joseph, we compassionate your suffering, and, together with the apostle, condole with you in your grief; and we rise to give thanks to him who has opened the eyes of a blind son ; and humbly beg of him who restored sight to the eyes of Tobias by means of salve made from the \^all of a fish, to enlighten the hearts of the followers of the Greek church, as well as your own, and by his divine providence in our time and yours to bring us back to one fold and one shepherd. Receive, therefore, dear brother, the book of which mention has been made by John in the Revelations, and look earnestly into it ; and although it may embitter your stomach, by the pricks of contrition, which pierce in the beginning of it, nevertheless, it will be sweet as honey in your mouth, according to the words of the betrothed, in the Psalms, \'Thy words shall sound in my ears ; for they are sweet.\' Consult, then, the dictates of your wisdom without any superstition; and when enlightened, you

On opening this book, you will find that the Roman pontiff is become all things to all men, that all may be safe, and is called to his station, not for the sake of filthy lucre, or of his own wish, but by his brethren, through divine inspiration ; and at once becoming a servant of the servants of God, he, together with his brethren, places himself forward as a wall for his brethren and fellow-bishops, and those subject to them, in opposition to heretics, schismatics, and tyrants, and for the defence of ecclesiastical liberties. And although there may be some exceptions, yet the church of Rome in modern times breathes freely from the incursions of all parties. But if the Greek church can (to use your own words) patiently endure words which nettle it, besides the dangers to souls which arise from their secession, these troubles ought to have given them sufficient sense, for in their hands the ecclesiastical order being divided out in various parts of opposing nations of the East, is put in confusion, the liberty of the Church is oppressed, and the dignity of the priesthood is trampled under-foot, and there is not one of its dear children to console it, since, being as it were, without a head, they refuse to return to the head of the Church : \* Return, therefore, oh !

Owing, therefore, to these and other circumstances, which, after a careful examination of the truth, may bring about a proper affection, instead of schism, we have thought proper to send to you, as bearers of these presents, the brothers Hugh and Peter, of the order of Preachers, and Haymon and Ealph, of the order of Minorites, men conspicuous for their i-eligion and virtue, renowned for the probity of their morals, and endowed with a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, according to the tenor of the abovenamed letters ; so that if you discuss boldly, and converse sociably with them on all points that concern the matter in question, you may hear the sound of thunder in the wheel which appeared below the wheel of Ezekiel, and observe in the glaissy sea, that one Adam was placed in Paradise, to enjoy and take care of it ; that he took to himself one wife ; that our Lord Jesus Christ was created in one justice, and took his one spouse, the church ; that Lamech, which means humble, whilst he divided one wife into two, became a bloody man, and killed a man to his hurt ; that we read of only one ark, which was steered safely over the deluge by one patriarch, saving alive a small but chosen number of souls ; how the Lord gave a law a second time to be different, yet the same ; how the faces of the two cherubims, which overshadow the mercy-seat, are not turned away from it, but look on each other ; that Joseph had one garment reaching to his feet, and our Lord had one seamless garment. However, if your belief is different from ours, and attributes a sense of duality to the sacrament of the Eucharist, consider that the Greeks and Latins celebrate the mystery of our salvation in the same manner, through one Lord Jesos Christ, who was subject to human passions when he took on himself human nature for our sake, but after his death was free from all passions. The Greeks, following the example of the younger disciple, and not immindfiil of such mercy, daily commemorate God\'s mercy in becoming subject to human passions, use a host of leavened bread, in order that, according to the apostle, the leaven may typify the oorruption to which, before his resurrection, our Lord was snbject.

Both, however, are plain bread before the sacrifice, and, therefore, cannot be distinguished as leavened or unleavened ; but one of these is rather believed to have been the living bread which descended firom heaven, and gave life to the world. Such are the doctrines which the Holy Spirit and sound reason have taught the Holy See ; and I pray that you, following the example of the younger disciple, who saw and believed, may at length enter in also, and, comprehending everything, may sing with us that psalm of David, \* Behold how good and joyful a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in\^imt\^ Given at the Lateran, the 17th of May, &c. &c.\" How the Greeks seceded from all obedience to the Roman church. The Greeks, although they heard these salutary warnings, paid no heed to them, nor did they submit themselves to the Roman church, perhaps, either through fear of its tyranny and avarice, or else, being contumacious\^ according to the \"words \"of the Evangelist, that those who were invited to the supper would not come, \" but all with one consent made excuses,\" being humble in their excuses, but proud and contumacious in the performance of their work. On this, the pope and his cardinals held a deliberate discussion on /this matter, and determined to send the whole army of the crusaders against them ; and, accordingly, a crusade was preached, and some assumed the cross to proceed against the Greeks, and especially the Constantinopolitans. The origin of this schism and dispute between the Greek and the Roman churches was as follows : --- \^A certain archbishop, having been canonically elected to a noble archbishopric in Greece, or having been nominated thereto, went to Rome to be con. firmed, but could not obtain a hearing there, without a pro\\y mise of an immense sum of \^aS\^ in return for obtaining what he demanded ; but he, detesting the simony of that mercenary court, went away without effecting his purpose, and told the circumstance to all the Greek nobility ; evidence was also given by others who had gone to Home, of similar

For we have to communicate good news, which we now do by these presents, namely, that, by the disposition of the providence of the Supreme King, who gives increase and health to kings, on the eighteenth day of the month of \^February a son was bom to us from the fruitful womb of our 1 august consort, and a new nephew was given to you. His \' birth tends to the glory of his father and his uncle, refreshes I the joy of his mother, and confirms the hopes of our subjects j I by this, the soimd mutual affection, in which we are bound by the ties of aflinity, is strengthened, and tends to the increase of our prosperity ; and the good of the Caesars turns i\^ out in time to the joy and honour of the whole community. T\'he birth of this same child happens in the midst of our exultation at our fortunate proceedings in Italy, which is now yielding to our sovereignty, and at our victory over our defeated enemies, a happy star accompanying these auspices. And since this long-desired son has been bom in the midst of these continued fortunate events and victories of ours, we trust in him who, after the birth of a daughter from our fruitful consort, your sister, has bestowed a male offspring, that he has libei\'ally increased the ancient glory of our empire, which having fallen away in former times, now rises renewed by his birth, to the honour and glory of us and our posterity ; and we wish you, who we know have long wished for the birth of this expected nephew, to share in the joy of us and oui;. august consort.

He therefore assailed the king with warnings and threats, and gave vent to great complaints and disaffection against him, because he had rashly managed important business of the kingdom, taking the advice of those \^reigners\^whom he had previously sworn to send entirely away from him ; and that dismissing all others from his side, he had not only listened to the counsels of Simon de Montfort and J. earl of Lincoln, but that they had, without i/\^ the connivance of his nobles, brought libout underhanded marriages : Simon, as has been above stated, having effected an unlawful marriage between him and the coimtess of Pembroke ; his sister and John earl of Lincoln; and Richard de Clare, son of the count of Boulogne, and his, the said Earl J.\*s daughter, unknown to the king. When Earl Richard \\ rose against the king, he was joined by Earl Gilbert Marshal, \' and all the earls and barons of England\^ and the citizens and \])eople in general. It was then most confidently hoped that !\^ri Richard would release the country from the wretched (glavej\^ with which it was (6ppresse5\^ by the Romans\^and the othet \^foreigngp\^ ; and all parties, from the old man to the boy, heapeoblessings upon him. No one adhered to the king, except only Hubert, earl of Kent ; and no fear was entertained of him, both because he had sworn never to carry arms, and also on account of his old age and his discretion, which had been proved on various occasions. The king, on finding how matters stood, both felt and showed his alarm, and sent messengers to each of the nobles of the kingdom, making earnest inquiries if he could rely on them for assistance ; to which they all, and especially the citizens of London, answered, that what Earl Richard had begun, was brought about with a view to their own honour, and the advantage of the whole kingdom, though he, the king, did not approve of his proceedings, and that, therefore, they would not oppose his designs. The legate, on finding this, saw that danger was imminent, and applied himself with the greatest dili\^

To this Earl Kichard replied : \" My lord legate, with the confirmation of the lands of the laity, you have nothing to do ; attend you to matters connected with the Church ; neither be astonished that the state of the kingdom excites me, since I am the only heir-apparent ; for, although the king had the charge of the land of almost all the episcopacies, and of many escheats, yet his treasure never showed any incrca\^ for the defence of his kingdom, although we were surrounded by various enemies on all sides ; besides, many are astonished that the king, who is chiefly in need of assistance and discretion, does not follow the tracks of discreet men ; he does not follow the track of the emperor, to whom we gave our sister in marriage with a large sum of money, hoping that it would be to our advantage ; for he only retained his wife, and sent back her attendants, without bestowing on one of them either lands or money, although he abounded in wealth and riches ; a similar example can be mentioned in the case of the French king, who married the elder sister of our queen. But our English king, on the contrary, has fattened all the kindred and relatives of his wife with lands, possessions, and . \^noney\^ and has contracted such a marriage that he cannot V be more enriched, but rather impoverished, so that he cannot pfTocure the aid of a military force, if it should be necessary. Morever,he allows the revenues and ecclesiastical benefices, bestowed by our pious ancestors\^ (especially on religious men)jto be seized on as spoil, and to be distributed amongst foreigner\^ although this country itself abounds in fitting men to receive them ; and England becomes, as it were, a vineyard without a wall, in which all who pass along the road gather the grapes.\" The legate endeavours to make peace between the king end hit noblet.

The king, then, seeing that his own sallies met with no favour, and that all parties inclined to his brother, Earl Eichard, tried all the shifts that he could, and demanded time for deliberation, in order to give a more suitable answer to their demands ; and accordingly, at the instance of those who asked for it (although after much difficulty), he was allowed time till the day after the first Sunday in Lent. The whole consultation turns to nothing. The nobles then met at London, on the appointed day, to arrange these matters ; and many came equipped with horses and aims, in order that if the king should withdraw &om his promise, he might be compelled to fulfil the foregoing terms. Then, after much argument and discussion amongst a great many present, the king submitted himself to the management of some of the more influential parties, and swore to abide by their decision, which was agreed to, and reduced to writing, and the seals of the legate and other nobles were affixed, to be shown to all parties in common. Before these matters were completely arranged, and whilst they were hanging in suspense, Simon de Montfort humbled himself to Earl Richard, and by means of many intercessors 911 d some presents, he obtained the kiss of peace from the said earl, which circumstance greatly annoyed some of the other nobles, without whose connivance this had been attempted, and by whose endeavours the matter had been carried thus far. Earl John, of Lincoln, in like manner, by entreaties as well as by 4\^be\^appeased the anger of Earl Richard, giving security, however, that he would atone to him in all respects for what he had done against him. By these irregular proceedings the whole business was in a great degree impeded, and not carried into effect, but protracted the miseries of the kingdom, and, in a great degree, clouded the fame of Earl Ricnard ; and thus he became an object o? suspicion, who was believed to have been the staff of their strength.

The sentence of the pope in the matter of the monks of Rochester. In this year, sentence was given by the pope in the case of the monks of Rochester, with respect to the controversy that had arisen between them and Archbishop Edmund, as to choosing their bishop ; the sentence was given in their favour, as well in the matter of claim as of possession ; and on St. Cuthbert\'s day, the bishop elect. Master Richard of Wendover, was confirmed. This said archbishop had convened these monks, exhausted by toil, and drained of money by the expense ; and had, moreover, crossed the Alps, that such a great dispute might be duly determined as the law dictated. \* There is some obscurity or corruption in the original of this passage : indeed, the text of Matthew Paris is far from accurate ; no doubt many passages have been corrupted by errors of the copyist, if not of the author, whilst others have possibly been incorrectly printed by the editor, Wats, whose work, however, on the whole, is a wonderful specimen of accuracy.

A.D. 1238.\] ARRIVAL OF THE EMPEROR OF CONSTANTINOPLE. 125 Sentence was likewise given at the same time against tlie said archbishop, who was then present at the court of Rome, in a matter of importance in dispute between him and the earl of Arundel; and in both cases he was condemned in the costs, about a thousand marks, and the sentence which he had pronounced on the aforesaid earl was withdrawn. For he had a most powerful enemy in the legate Otto, who had effectually urged the king on to this. The arrival in England qfihe emperor of Constantinople. In the same year, Baldwin, emperor of Constantinople, the youthful son of Peter, count of Auxerre, came to England to ask assistance, having been expelled and banished from his empire. But on his landing at Dover, he was told on behalf of the king, that it was ill-advised and improper for such a potent prince to intrude into a foreign kingdom without asking the opinion of the king, and without his leave ; and that it looked like contemptuousness and pride. This arrival, too, was displeasing in the sight of the king and his councillors ; for they recollected how many honours and benefits had been conferred by England on King John de Brienne on his coming there, who, when he returned to France, wickedly, and like an ungrateful man, planned treachery against the kingdom of England; however, on leaving France, being summoned under an unpropitious star to the imperial sovereignty of the Greeks, he did not carry his treachery into effect. The emperor of Constantinople, having been informed of these matters, waa sorry he had come to England, and prepared for a speedy return, at the same time pleading his innocence to the king, and humbly setting forth the reasons of his journey. The king, on hearing this, after taking counsel, sent word to him that, as he had not come as an enemy, he might enter the kingdom, and come to London, where he himself would meet him with due honour. The emperor, therefore, on the 22nd of April, came to London, and having been met by the king at Woodstock, and been admitted to the kiss of peace, he explained to the king and Earl Bichard the cause of his coming ; and on his parting from them, he was enriched with many costly presents, and carried away with him about seven hundred /\^ marks.

126 MATTHEW PARI& \[a.D. 1238. A disagreement between the legate and the scholars of Ojtford, At this time, the legate, having come to Oxford, and been received with the highest honour, as was due to him, wafl entertained in the house of the canons, which was at Oseney Abbey, where the scholar-clerks before breakfest-time\* sent him an honourable present, in the way of meat and drink, and after breakfast proceeded to his place of abode to pay their salutation to hun, and to visit him out of respect. On their approach, however, a transalpine porter, with unbecoming and improper raillery, raising his voice after the manner of the Romans, and, holding the door a little open, said, \*\* What do you want?\" To which the clerks replied, \*\*We want his lordship the legate, that we may pay our respects to him ;\" for they confidently believed that they would receive honour for honour. The doorkeeper, however, with taunting speeches, saucily refused admittance to them all, with haughtiness and abuse ; on seeing which, the clerks rushed forward with impetuosity, and forced their way in, whilst the(T5\>oman attendant8,7\^in their endeavours to keep them back, slruck\'tKein\'with their fists and sticks. Whilst the contending parties were engaged in repeated blows and taunts, it happened that a poor Irish chaplain was standing at the door of the kitchen, and had earnestly besought for something to be given to him, in God\'s name, after the custom of a poor and hungry man, when the master of the Teste\'s co\^5 (who was also his brother, and whom he had placed at the head of that office, that no poison might be given to him, which he, the legate, greatly feared) heard him, but paid no heed to his request ; and, becoming angry with the poor man, threw in his fexie some boiling water drawn from the caldron where fat meat was being cooked. At this injury to the poor man, one of the clerks, a native of the Welsh borders, cried out, \" Shame on us to endure anything like this f and drew a bow which he carried (for, as the tumult had increased, some of the clerks had seized on whatever arms came to hand), and by an arrow discharged &om it, himself pierced the body of the cook (whom the clerks satirically called \" Nabuzardan,\'\* that means chief of the \* Prandium, the earlier of the two daily meala.

When the darkness of the night had put an end to the tumult, he put off his canonical dress, quickly moimted his best horse, and, under the guidance of some persons who knew the most private fords, crossed the river at the nearest part to him, although with much danger, for the purpose of flying under the protection of the king\'s wings as soon as possible ; for the clerks, carried away by rage, continued to seek for the legate in the most secret hiding-places, crying out, \" Where is that simoniacal usurer, that plunderer of revenues, and thirster for money, \^y who perverts the king, subverts the kingdom, and enriches foreigners with spoil taken from usi\" Th\^\^lagntfi\^ in his flight, hearing the cries of his pursuers, (\^d within himsel\^\^ \^ Qaum furor in oaxvfi est, currenti cede furori ; \[When madness at fall speed doth run, A wise man seeks its path to shun ;\] and, patiently enduring all these things, he became like a man who did not hear them, and as if he had no power to refute them. Having crossed the river with much trouble (as above mentioned), and with only a few attendants, owing to the difficulty of the passage, the rest remaining concealed in the convent, he came to the king breathless, and in a state of alarm, and, with tears and sighs interrupting his discourse, he explained to the king, as well as his attendaiits, the series of events which had happened, making a serious complaint in the matter. The king was astonished at his pitiable story, and sympathized much with him, and sent the earl of Warrenne with an armed troop to Oxford, with all haste, to rescue the Eomans who were lying conceHsded there, and to arrest the scholars ; amongst the latter, one Master Odo, a lawyer, was roughly seized, and, together with thirty others, was ignominiously consigned to close imprisonment in the castle of Wallingford, near Oxford ; whilst the legate, thus liberated from the broken snare, summoned some of the bishops, laid Oxford under an interdict, and excommunicated all the abettors of this enormous offence.

The reconciiiation of the university qf Oxford with the legate. The legate, who had set out, on a journey towards the north of England, turned rein and returned to London. There he scarcely dared to remain in the regal abode of the bishop of Winchester, where he usually stayed ; and the king sent word to the city of London, that the mayor of the city, and the whole community of the citizens, were, with an armed body of men, to keep diligent watch over the said legate, and to guard him as the pupil of their eye. The legate, then, by virtue of the authority which he held, summoned the archbishop of York, and all the bishops of England, to assemble at London, on the 17th of May, there to discuss the condition of the Church, and the perilous condition of the clergy. Having assembled on the pre-appointed day, the bishops debated about the means of saving the whole clerical body, as if it were a second church ; the legate, also, condescended to them, saving the honour of the Koman church, lest it might be said in reproach, that he, who had come to reform the clergy and the Church, rather deformed them. At length it was suggested to the legate, by the bishops and the whole of the clergy present, that the dispute took its rise from his own dependants ; but at the end of the dispute the clergy got the worst of it, for, by his orders, a great portion of them were committed to prison ; the rest of them, in obedience to his orders, were ready humbly to make submission, at a place about three days\' journey from Oxford, to whom, on the petition of so many great men, his mind ought to be inclined to mercy. At length it was arranged that the legate would grant this mercy, on condition that all the scholars there assembled should proceed on foot, in company with the bishops, also on foot, from St. Paul\'s church, which was nearly a mile distant from the abode of the legate, until they reached the abode of the bishop, of Carlisle, and from thence should go, without hoods and cloaks, and barefooted, to the abode of the legate, where they would humbly ask pardon, which would be granted

This was done ; and the legate, seeing this humiliation, received them again into his favour, restored the University to its municipal site, mercifully withdrew the interdict with the sentence of excommunication, and granted them letters that, on this account, no stain of disgrace should at any time be thrown on them. Immediately after Easter of this year, the king of England sent a body of troops, under the command of Hemy de Trubleville, a most skilful soldier, to assist the emperor against his rebellious subjects in the Italian provinces ; and with it he also sent J. Mansel and William Hardel, a clerk and citizen of London, with a sum of money for distribution amongst the mercenaries. Bravely did this army of the king fight for the emperor during the whole summer ; for they conquered the citizens of some of the cities that resisted, and restored the cities to the empire. Amongst those who distinguished themselves, was the said J. Mansel. The pope was greatly annoyed at all this ; and the king of England, about this time, sending him a letter, begging of him to deal more gently with the emperor, he was more severely vexed, replied to the letter in a manner unbecoming him, and was excited to such a pitch of anger, that for a long time all matters, especially those connected with the English, were suspended. When the bishop of Valentia heard that such an army was about to set out for Italy, he cunningly joined the lord Henry de Trubleville, as their guide, and sailed with him. In the same year, Baldwin, emperor of Constantinople, of whom mention was made above, after having obtained from the king five hundred marks, and a large sum from Earl Richard, returned to his own country. About the same time, too, the bishop elect of Valentia, finding that his stay in England was agreeable to no one, either of lus own accord, or against his will, set sail, but with due caution, however, because his horses were laden, and his saddles filled with gold and silver and royal vessels.

Simon de Montfbrt betakes hvnMe\\f to the Homan court from the emperor. In the mean time, Simon de Montfort betook himself with the good wishes of the emperor, and supplicatory letters I from him\^Jiftthe Eoman court, where, by gifts of an endless sum of (mone\^ and promises, he obtained a decree from the pope, that, although his vow solemnly made before Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, opposed it, he might enjoy his , unlawful marriage, and his holiness wrote to the legate Otto, ordering him to give a special decree in favour of Simon de ; Montfort. On hearing this, Brother William of Abingdon, of the order of Preachers, and many other learned men, who had the zeal of God before their eyes, loudly blamed this sentence, affirming, with truth, that the pope\'s holiness was imposed upon ; that souls were endangered ; and that Christ was roused to jealousy. For although, as the opposing party declared, the woman in question may not have assumed the habit and veil, yet she has taken the ring, with which she has devoted, or rather betrothed herself to Christ, and iSj therefore, indissolubly united to Christ her spouse, as witness the authentic writing in the decrees of Master Peter, in; his treatise on the \" Vow,\'\* in the fourth book ; in which, after premising the reasons and authority of the saints and canons, he proceeds to say : \'\* From these things it appears, that \^d\^giI!s, or widows, bound by a vow of continenc\^ whether they have taken the veil or not, can in nowise be married. Which is to be understood in the same manner with regard to all who have made a vow of continence ; and what was lawful before the vow, will be unlawful after.\"

A.D. 1238.\] RAVAGES OP THE TARTARS. 131 Perhaps, however, the Roman court had in view something of deeper meaning than we could understand. The Tartars ravage the northern countries. About this time, special ambassadors were sent by the Saracens, chiefly on behalf of the old man of the mountain, to the French king, telling him that a monstrous and inhuman race of men had burst forth from the northern mountains, and had taken possession of the extensive, rich lands of the East ; that they had depopulated Hungary Major\^ and had sent threatening letters, with dreadfrd embassies ; the chief of whom declared, that he was the messenger of Grod on high, sent to subdue the nations who rebelled against him. These people have very large heads, I by no means proportionate to their bodies, and feed on raw \\ flesh, and even on human beings ; they are incomparable 1 archers, and cross oyer any rivers in portable boats, made of hides ; of robust strength, and large in their bodies, impious and inexorable men ; and their hmguage is unknown to all within reach of our knowledge. They abound in flocks, herds, and breeds of horses ; the horses are very swift, and able to perform a joinmey of three days in one ; the men are well armed in fix)nt, but not behind, that they may not take to flight ; and their chief is a most ferocious man, named(\^han\]\^ These people inhabit the northern region, either the Caspian mountains, or the adjacent places, and are called \" Tartars,\'\* from the river Tar ; they are very numerous, and are beUeved to have been sent as a plague on mankind, and although they had sallied forth on other occasions, they seemed this year to iBge more fiercely than usual. The inhabitants of Gothland and Friesland, dreading their attacks, did not, as . /\^ was their custom, come to Yarmouth, in England, at the time of the herring-fisheries, at which place their ships usually loaded ; and, owing to this, herrings in that year were considered of no value, on account of their abundance, and about forty or fifty, although very good, were sold for one piece of silver, even in places at a great distance from the sea. This powerful and noble Saracen messenger, who had come to the French king, was sent on behalf of the whole of the people of the East to tell these things ; and he asked assistance from the western nations\^ the better to bt\^ k2

The bishop of Winchester, who happened to be then present, and wearing the sign of the cross, interrupted his speech, and replied jocosely, \"Let us leave these dogs to devour one . \' another, that they may all be consumed, and perish ; and we, when we proceed against the enemies of Christ who remain, will slay them, and cleanse the face of the earth, so that all the world will be subject to the one Catholic church, and .(v\"\" .\' there will be one shepherd and one fold.\" •\"\^ Death of Peter de Roches, bishop of Winchester, On the ninth of J\\me, in the same year, died Peter de Roches, bishop of Winchester, who, after having governed the church of Winchester for about thirty-two years, and having laudably fulfilled his pilgrimage to the Holy Land, in company with the bishop of Exeter, and having built several houses for religious persons, and made a noble testament, closed his life, ftiU of years, at his manor of Famham. He was buried in his church at Winchester, where he had, during his life, chosen an humble tomb. By his death, the whole council, as well regal as ecclesiastical, of the English kingdom incurred an irreparable loss ; and it must not be omitted, that whatever honour or advantage was contributed to the Church, either during peace, or a truce, or even during the war in the Holy Land, when the emperor Frederick went there, was nobly brought about and prudently carried into effect by the counsels and assistance of this same bishop.

In the Holy Land, too, by transferring the church of St. Thomas the martjrr, from an improper to a suitable place, he changed the order of the brothers of that church to a more competent order, so that, relying on the assistance of the patriarch of Jerusalem, those who had been formerly seculars in deed and dress, now carry the cross on their breasts, and are subject to the order of the Templars : he strengthened Joppa, a renowned place of refuge for the Christians ; he made a remarkable testament, and bequeathed such an immense sum of money to each of the aforesaid places, that to the house of St. Thomas, at Acre, to which he bequeathed the least, he asagned five hundred marks. Besides this, he left to his successor a rich bishopric, with no diminution of its plough cattle. The king, when he heard of the death of Peter of Winchester, caused William, bishop elect of Valentia, to be appointed to that bishopric ; but the chancellor, Ralph de Neville, bishop of Chichester, having been duly demanded, against the wish of the king, by the convent of Winchester, to whom the right of election be- \\y longed, the king dismissed mm tney wisned to\~have\~from Ins council and his court, \^er taking from him the seal which had been intrusted to the said chancellor by the advice of the whole kingdom ; and by means of his

The Milanese, in the mean time, were not idle, but surrounded their city with deep trenches, and continued frequently to assist the citizens of Brescia. In this way the summer season was spent and ended, so that on the approach of winter, a truce was agreed to by consent of both parties, and those who had come to the assistance of the emperor, went away without effecting their purpose ; and the emperor himself as he could not conquer and subject to his rule the city of Brescia, which was a small one in comparison to the other cities, became less formidable to his enemies, and less respected by his friends.

Although he had left England with the good-will of the conventual assembly, he obtained from the pope a decree in his favour against the monks of Canterbury ; owing to which an irregular and unbecoming disagreement arose between the shepherd and his flock, and the Church suffered much loss and dishonour, suspense and ignominy. On this the legate was invited to correct this deformity, and, whilst presiding at the chapter at Canterbury, because a certain book, containing a privilege obtained in the time of St. Thomas, had been imprudently burned by some persons, he deposed the prior of that place, and sent him to a more rigorous order, there to perform continual penance, and dispersed some of the monks ; for (as was stated) he had privily erased from the

A.D. 1238.\] THE MONKS REFUSE WILLIAM OF VALENTIA. 135 aforesaid privilege the things which plainly appeared to be . against them, and had inserted other things which seemed \^ to plead in their favour ; and because such erasures, in such an authentic book, could not escape the notice of persons who careftilly examined it, one of the brothers unadvisedly burned it, that the convent might not incur the brand of infamy and of falsehood. Wherefore, on the archbishop\'s making mention of that book, and asking for it, and when, on its not being found, they made a true confession of what had occurred, the legate was justly enraged, and, in punishment for such a great fault (as has been above mentioned), removed the prior from his office, dispersed some of the brethren who appeared guilty, ordering them to live more strictly and in continual peuance. Afterwards, because the prior entered the chapterhouse with some seculars to make an election, against the approved custom of the house, the conventual assembly elected a prior over them, without the consent of the archbishop. The archbishop then, on hearing this, disapproved and quashed the election, and not only suspended, but also excommunicated both the prior elect and the electors ; but the conventual assembly boldly appealed, in this matter, against the archbishop to the pope. The king endeavours to effect the election of William elect of Valentia\^ to the bishopric of Winchester. At this time, the king (although he had often before sworn to dismiss, and not to advance the interest of, (foreignefs) applied all possible industry, more than he ought, and by / improper means, to obtain the promotion and election of William elect of Valentia (who was said to be a man of blood), to the bishopric of Winchester. But this the monks, to whom the right of election is known to belong, firmly refused amongst themselves, and went to the king, as was the custom, demanding permission to elect their bishop ; the king, however, before giving them any reply, begged of them to elect William, bishop elect of VjJentia, whom he called his uncle \\ the monks dissembled, and demanded time to deliberate on the matter with the rest of the conventual assembly, to whom the right of election belonged. The king, however, felt that, by granting them this respite, his entreaties would fail of effect, turned off to his usual cavillings, and in reply to the petition of the monks said, \" I have

---

136 MATTHEW PARIS. \[a.D. 1238. been informed that two archdeacons of the bishopric of Winchester are bound to be present at your election ; these I do not see in the present case, therefore I cannot comply with your petition.\" To this the monks replied, that, \" although they ought to be present at the election (which to us seems absurd and inconsistent with justice), they need not be present at the demand for an election ;\" and thus the king, although he kicked against it for a long time, could not oppose tEelr JiisiB demand. But some time afterwards, when he was credibly informed that the monks seriously entertained the idea of electing William de Rsele, a man altogether praiseworthy, for their bishop, and that all had consented to it, he was greatly enraged, and sneeringly replied, \" You refused the bishop elect of Valentia, saying that he was a man of blood, and have now elected William de Rsele, who has killed more men with his tongue than any one else with a sword ;\" and so he haughtily and abusively swore that he would never, by any means, endure this. The monks, therefore, fearing \^,{.\'\^\" ; the kings anger, turned aside from their intention, and, in ; the mean time, the king destroyed the possessions and V , \' I improvements of the bishopric, and often lay in the manors I belonging to it, attended by a numerous company. The king causes the election of Ralph, bishop of Chichester , to be quashed. The monks then, seeing the injurious effects of delay, began diligently to consider about choosing a pastor for themselves, on learning which the king hastened thither immediately, and, entering the chapter-house more eagerly than became him, demanded of the monks, with threats and promises, that they should elect his uncle, the bishop elect of Valentia. They, however, cunningly wishing to turn aside the king\'s anger, endeavoured to soften his indiscreet violent by delay ; but not being willing to consent to his demands, they, by unanimous consent, demanded RalphTde Neville, bishop of Chichester, and the king\'s chancellor, for their bishop and the pastor of their souls. The king, finding that his entreaties had again failed in their effect, opposed the just demand of the monks, and heaped much abuse on the said bishop, saying, that he was impetuous, passionate, and perverse, and called them fools for having demanded him for a bishop. Besides this, he forcibly took away his seal, which

Following up his violence as he had begun, he sent Simon the Norman, and Alexander a secular, two hired lawyers, to the court of Rome, who, by \^ge fflSs and promises o\^jrioney\^ deprived \^ a just man of his right, quashed a just decision, and corruptly annulled the aforesaid demand. The Milanese desire to be reconciled to the emperor Frederick, At this time the Milanese, fearing the imperial mightiness, sent to the emperor, with all possible earnestness, begging him, whom they openly declared to be their true and natural lord, to avert his anger from them, to cease to attack them, and to cherish and protect them, as his liege subjects, under the wings of his mighty protection. They declared that they would thenceforth, as formerly, serve him as their lord and emperor, with all reverence ; that, in token of this obedience, and that they might be protected in the arms of his affection, and that their previous rebellion might not be remembered, they would freely give him all the substance they possessed in gold and silver ; moreover that, as a sign of their subjection and obedience, and of the imperial victory, they would collect all their standards and bum them at the feet of the emperor. Besides this, that they would, when he, the emperor, was again fighting in the service of the cross in the Holy Land, find him annually ten thousand soldiers for the advancement of the Church and for his own honour, on the condition that he would love the citizens without any dissembled malice, and that the state of the city and citizens should be maintained. But the emperor proudly reftised all these offers, demanding unalterably that the citizens, in common with their city and all their property, should resign themselves and theirs absolutely to his pleasure. To this piece of(\|yrann\^of his, the citizens, with one consent, replied that they would on no account do this, for, said they, \" We have learned by experience, and fear your cruelty ; we would rather die under our shields by the sword, or spear, or by javelins, than by treachery, famine, and flames.\" From that

According to the words of the Grospel, \" God resisteth the proud, but gives grace to the humble.\" The Milanese, then, seeing that it was a matter of life and death, fortified their city more eagerly than usual with arms and trenches, and by entering into alliance with other cities. The event of brother Johtif of the order of Preachers, About this same time, one of the order of Preachers, named brother John, a learned and eloquent man, and pleasing in his office as a Preacher, enjoyed very great reputation in Italy ; so much so, that he appeased wars amidst the \^ citizens, and God worked miracles for him, for he crossed \^ rivers dry shod, ahd\^ compelled vultures flying in the air to descend to the earth at his bidding. At length, however, by the wiles of the devil, he became elated by his renown, and weakened by intimacy with his carnal friends, and thus deservedly lost the love of God, the honour of mankind, and also the respect of the prelates. A certain villain attempts to murder the king in his bedchamber. In the same year, a perilous adventure happened to this king, throwing all people into great alarm. For, on the day after the Nativity of St. Mary, a certain learned esquire, as it is said, came to the king\'s court at Woodstock, pretending that he was insane, and said to the king, \" Resign to me the kingdom, which you have unjustly usurped, and so long detained from me ;\" he also added, that he bore the sign of royalty on his shoulder. The king\'s attendants wanted to beat him and drive him away from the royal presence, but the king prevented those who were rushing on him from violence, saying, \" Let the insane man rave as becomes him, for such people\'s words have not the influence of truth.\" In the middle of the night, however, this same man entered the king\'s bedchamber window, carrying an open knife, and approached the king\'s couch, but was confused at not finding him there, and immediately began to look for him in the several chambers of his residence. The king was, by God\'s providence, then sleeping with the queen. But one of the queen\'s maids, named Margaret Biseth, was by

At her dreadful cry the king\'s attendants awoke, and leaped from their beds with all speed, and running to the spot, broke open the door, which this robber had firmly secured with a bolt, and seized the robber, and, notwithstanding his resistance, bound him &st and secured him. He, after some time, confessed that he had been sent there to kill the king, after the manner of the assassins, by William Marsh, son of Greofi&\*ey Marsh, and he stated that others had conspired to commit the same crime. On learning this, the king ordered him, as guilty of an attempt to murder the king\'s majesty, to be torn Hmb from limb by horses, at Coventry, a terrible example, and lamentable sight to all who dared to plot such crimes. In the first place, he was dragged asunder, then beheaded, and his body divided into three parts ; each part was then dragged through one of the principal cities of England, and was afterwards hung on a gibbet used for robbers. A heavy storm of wind. About the feast of St. Matthew (Sept. 21), a storm of wind raged with such destructive violence that, without mentioning other incalculable and irreparable damage, more than twenty ships were sunk at Portsmouth. Simon de Monffbrt returns into England. On St. Calixtus\'s day (Oct. 14), Simon de Montfort returned from the continent, and was received by the king and all the royalists to the kiss of peace. He then set out with all haste to his wife Eleanor, who was staying at Kenilworth, very near her confinement. The abbots of the Black order are cited before the legate\^ at London, In the same year, the legate Otto, by authority of the pope, cited all the abbats of the Black order to appear before him in St. Martin\'s church, at London, there to consider of the decrees which his holiness the pope, after due deliberation, had ordained for the reformation of the monastic order.

In the oratory, refectory, and dormitory, continual sQence shall be observed, and in the cloister also, at certain times, and in certain places, according to the ancient custom of the monastery. No one at all shall eat meat in the refectory, not even on any public solemnities, as has been sometime the custom of the convent ; but let him leave a few in the refectory, and go out with the abbat to eat the meat outside, as in these days particularly discipline ought to be more strictly observed : let them not, however, tlunk that they are allowed to eat flesh outside the refectory, unless it is in the infirmary, although the abbat may sometimes, by way of indulgence, summon some of the brethren to him, sometimes one, apd sometimes another, and treat them to better fare in his own room. Besides, sick and weak brethren, who need strengthening, or some medicine, may receive a proper quantity of what is necessary for them, both of meat and of other things ; not, however, privately in their rooms, but all in the infirmaiy.

Let not the abbat think that he can give a monk dispensation to hold property ; for the renouncing of property and the preservation of chastity are so connected with the monastic regulations, that not even the supreme pontiff can grant him indulgence in these matters.\" Further concerning the same\* \*\* In each kingdom, or province, there shall be, every three years, saving the right of the diocesan bishops, a general chapter of abbats, and of priors who have no abbats connected with them, and who have not been accustomed to hold such a chapter, at which all, who have no canonical obstruction, shall assemble at one of the monasteries suitable to this purpose, with this restriction, namely, that no one of them shall bring with him more than six carriages and eight persons. Let them, also, at the commencement of this new matter, summon two neighbouring abbats of the Cistercian order, to give them opportune advice and assistance, as they are, from long custom, better versed in chaptera of this kind ; and let them unite with themselves any two they may think expedient ; and let these four preside over the whole chapter, so that not one of them may assume to himself superiority . of prelateship; and, when expedient, an alteration can be made j after careful deliberation.

But if it should happen that, on account of their great numEers, they cannot conveniently be placed elsewhere, they may be received, by a dispensation, in the same nunneries, to prevent their again wandering forth in the world to their destruction, their former places being changed, and they being appointed and assigned to inferior ones ; and this we decree to be observed with regard to monks and other regulars : and that they may not be able to excuse themselves by a plea of simplicity or ignorance, we order that the diocesan bishops shall, every year, cause this to be feithfully published, word for word.\" Of the sentence of excommunication. \" In whatsoever way monks and regular canons may have •smitten one another in the cloister, they are not on that account to be sent to the Apostolic See, but shall be subjected to discipline at the discretion of their abbat ; and if the abbat\'s discretion is not sufficient to decide on their punishment, he must be assisted by the wisdom of the diocesan.\" Item on the same subject. \" We have heard the question raised by your community\^\] whether a layman, who presumes to lay rash hands on a / clerk, monk, or convert, at the bidding or command of the \\\< person in whose service he is, will incur the sentence of excommunication, especially if there is no reason for his being beaten.

With regard to these, we think a distinction ought to be made, that such men either do know that they are bound by the chain of excommuni-\' cation, or do not recollect the fact for which they have fallen under the rule of the sentence pronounced, or although they know the fact, are ignorant of the law, and do not know they are constrained therefore by it. We consider that the first, if they be seculars, ought to be for ever deposed from all orders they have received ; in the other cases, archbishops as well as bishops, are to know that they have not the power of granting dispensations without the mandate of the Apostolic See ; and the granting of absolution to such persons is altogether interdicted to them ; and the greater matters are to be understood as forbidden to them to whom the smaller only are . so expressed as forbidden. Cases of this kind may, however, be conveyed to the ears of the Eoman pontiff, that from him may be procured an answer according to the rigour or equity of the case, as his discretion may think fit. But if monks com\> mit an offence of this kind, although it has been decreed by Pope Alexander that monks and regular canons, however they may have smitten one another in the cloister, are not, on that account, to be sent to the Apostolic See, but are to be subjected to discipline, at the discretion of the abbat, and if the discretion of the abbat is not sufficient to decide on the punishment, he is to be assisted by the wisdom of the diocesan ; and although elsewhere he says, that those fljdng from the world, who have taken the religious habit in a monastery, and who afterwards confess, amongst other things, that they have committed such an offence, by which they have, ipso facto, incurred the sentence of excommunication, yet, without the permission of the Boman pontiff, the abbat ought not and cannot absolve them, yet he may punish the offenders by a due correction.

Baldwin\^ emperor qf Constantinople \^ marches into Greece with an armed/crce. About this time, the emperor Baldwin, of Constantinople, set out for the Greek provinces in great force, to subdue those who had rebelled against himself and the Roman church, attended by as large a force as all his allies and relations could furnish ; and in order to replenish Hs treasury, sold all his most precious relics to the French king, and pledged some of his most valuable property. For (as has been above stated) he was sprung from the French nobility. The pope also, to the annoyance and vexation of his rival, the emperor Frederick, extended an assisting hand to him by all the means in his power. The birth of a son to Simon de Mont/ort, In Advent of the same year, whilst A., bishop of Chester, was proceeding to London on a summons from the king, the eldest son of Simon de Montfort, by Eleanor his wife, was bom at Kenilworth, to add to the strength and comfort of the kingdom ; for it was feared that the queen might be barren. The bishop, therefore, in order the more to ingratiate himself with the king, stayed there some little time, and baptized the child : and on the same day took to his bed, being attacked by a severe illness, which brought him to the point of death. The archbishop qf Antioch claims superiority over the Roman pontiff. In the same year, the archbishop of Antioch (with the agreement of Grerman, archbishop of Constantinople, advocate of the Greeks, and vicegerent of the anti-pope) presumed with rash violence to break forth into such audacity, that by an empty authority he excommunicated the pope, with the whole Boman church and court, and solenmly preaching l)lasphemy, he set himself and his church before his holiness the pope and the Roman church, both in age and rank ; that it was and had been superior to the Roman church. ?.

Therefore, deservedly ought that city and pro\> vince, together with its citizens and inhabitants, to be dearer and more beloved by the apostle St. Peter, which showed honour and reverence to him, than those which inflicted torments on him and dishonoured him. And it was evident that he liberally conferred the power of binding and loosing on the Greek church rather than on that of Rome, which waA now defiled by the stains of viamon\^and( usury; \^aii\^ and other sins.

This same Eobert, before he .assumed the religious habit, had been a Bugare, owing to which he knew all their confederates, and became an accuser, a hammer, and especial enemy to them. At length, however, abusing the power intrusted to him, and passing the bounds of moderation and justice, he became elated, powerful, and formidable, involved the good with the bad, and punished the innocent and simpleminded.

For it was reported that the emperor Frederick had said (although it may not be proper to mention it), that three conjurers had so craftily led away their contemporaries as to gain for themselves the mastery of the world : these were, Moses, Jesus, and Mahomet ; and that he had impiously put forward some wicked and incredible ravings and blasphemies respecting the most holy eucharist. Far be it, far be it, from any discreet man, much less a Christian, to unlock his mouth and tongue in such raving blasphemy.

For the church of that place still procured and suppHed the king with a sufficiency, nay, even with abundance of necessaries for all these convivial expenses ; and this the king was not in the least sorry for. For which deed, if he had had a strict, influential\^ and feithful rebuker\^ he deserved to be severely reproached ; and if it liad not been that his gifts of charity, which he largely and liberally continued to bestow (and which, as our Holy Scripture teaches us, covers our sins), redeemed such deeds, it would have originated great peril to himself and the kingdom, by arous- \^p \*s angeSigainst him. When, however, on Christmas day, the divine service had been performed and completed in a becomingly solemn and magnificent manner, that the joys of this world might not come unalloyed, an unlooked-for event entirely disturbed all their convivial pleasure. Wh\^n the king made his appearance in his royal palace to take his break&st, Gilbert, earl marshal, came to the door with his fellow-knights to obtain admittance \] but when the oarl came up and wished to enter, the king\'s doorkeepers suid marshals saucily denied him admittance, and with their wands drove back his retinue with insolence and abuse. When the earl saw this, he felt convinced that some whisperer had sown the seeds of discord between him and the king, and that this had been done not without the king\'s authority ; he however dissembled his feelings, and returned to the city to his own house, and then, in order that the harmony of the festival might not be overclouded, he invited, by sound of trumpet, not only his own friends, but as many others as chose to assemble at his table, to breakfast. On the morrow, however, he sent some men of rank to the king, and demanded of him why he had without cause inflicted such a great injury on him, the earl, who was his faithful subject, and of such noble birth, and especially on such a ■day, and declared that he was prepared to clear himself by triaJ, on all points, against all who had wickedly excited «nmity between two such illustrious persons.

W. de Rale is elected bishop qf Chester. About this time, the monks of Coventry, seeing that the king always contumaciously obstructed the canonical proceedings at their elections, and did not agree to any one elected by them, to whom the royal favour did not incline, in order that their church might not any longer suffer irre- / parable losses and injury by protracted delay and expecta- \^ . \') tion, about the feast of St. Matthew, unanimously elected l\^i\^\' \^\^(\^\"\^ \"William de Rsele, a special clerk of the kiAg\'s, a discreet man, ( \\ • \' and one skilled in the laws of the land, to be their bishop, and the pastor of their souls, as being a man in whom there appeared no stain that might provoke rejection or opposition.

Otto, to return to Rome immediately ; on which the legate summoned all the bishops of England to assemble at London on the day when the psahn, \"Let Jerusalem rejoice,\" is chanted, to discuss as to his return, and arrange for his safe conduct. The king, however, when he heard of this, was in alarm for himself respecting the Parliament about to assemble in the octaves of Easter, when he had expected the arrival of the bishop elect of Valentia ; and as he placed all his trust in the legate\'s being present, he was very much grieved, and dreaded lest the nol)les and men of rank of the kingdom should wi\^h one consent rise against him for his divers and fi\^uent excesses and transgressions against the constitutions so often promised and sworn to be observed. He, therefore, by the most urgent entreaties, prevailed on the legate to send the most expeditious messengers, with all possible haste, to the pope, and to stay in England, in order that, by his means, the impending disturbance might be quelled ; and the legate remained, not wishing to grieve the king by reftising his request.

/ 162 MATTHEW PARIS. \[a.D. 1239. Peter the Saracen offers the emperor a large turn qf money /or hie ransom. About this time, Peter the Saracen, whom the emperor Frederick detained as prisoner for his ransom, offered ten thousand pounds sterling to obtain the emperor\'s favour, and thus be set at liberty ; and this the emperor agreed to, on condition that his friend, the king of England, would become security for the payment of such a large sum of money, and that neither the 9aid Peter the Saracen, nor any one of his followers, would thenceforth, on this account, injure his imperial majesty. The aforesaid Peter then wrote to his holiness the pope, and his other Mends, begging them, as he had always been ready and willing to spend his money to promote the welfare of the Eomans, to exhort the said king o\^ England, both by means of the legate and other \^miliars of his, to pledge himself and his kingdom to the fulfilment of the aforesaid terms. The legate then became a diligent mediator and agent in this business, and said that he could not honourably refuse to aid his imprisoned messenger ; but the king, seeing the trap that was prepared for him, and how great the danger would be to his kingdom, but that it was of no concern to the Homans provided that their property was saved to them, burst forth into words of anger, swearing that he was sorry he had abandoned honest Englishmen, and summoned the legate to England, who had wasted the property of the land and confounded right with wrong. Under such rulers, then, England became, as it were, a vineyard, from which all who passed on the road plucked the grapes, not having any wall enclosing it, nor any guardian watching over it, for what the ecclesiastical warmth at one time forbade, it at another allowed. Sardinia is given up to the emperor. In this year, whilst the emperor was wintering in Italy, the rich inlands lying in the Mediterranean next adjoining the city of Pisa, namely, the greatest and most powerftJ part of Sardinia, were given up to him. The right of this island was said to belong especially to the patrimony of St. Peter, but the emperor asserted that it belonged from times of old to the empire, but that the emperors had lost it owing to

When the pope heard of this he was filled with the greatest indignation, and rose up to take open vengeance, for he considered it a great loss. The said island of Sardinia was, indeed, a place of refuge for merchants, the comfort of shipwrecked people, and an asylum for exiles ; and is governed by four chiefs, whom they call judges. The loss was heavy, but the manner of its loss was more heavy to endure, and seemed to be an injury ; and the hatred which sprung up between the pope and the emperor, like an old wound, produced foul matter. The archbishop qf Canterbury harasses the monks. About this time. Archbishop Edmimd laid his hands more heavily on his monks ; the church of the monks of Canterbury was laid imder an interdict, and the new prior, whom they had elected, he excommunicated, as well as those who elected him. A dispute between the bishop qf Lincoln and his canons. The bishop of Lincoln also became a hammer and cruel persecutor of the religious men in his diocese ; for he unhesitatingly rose against the canons of his own cathedral church, who had created him, and earnestly demanded that the dean of Lincoln should be set aside, and that they should be visited by the bishop himseli\^ contrary to what had been the custom of the church from time immemorial ; the canons, however, urged an appeal, and after protracting the time, and disputing a great deal, at length referred the matter to umpires, namely, Walter, bishop of Worcester and archdeacon of the same place, and Master A. of Beccles ; and if they should not proceed canonically, either party would be allowed to appeal again to the pope, both parties in the mean time ceasing to visit, by which addition, namely, \" both parties in the mean time ceasing to visit,\" it would seem that the canonical party was in danger, for the bishop never visited, 9.nd he who has never commenced could not cease, as m2

Strife and controversy having thus arisen amongst them, even to the stirring up of angry feelings, the canons did not allow the bishop to enter the chapter, or to make any visitation amongst them ; and they openly declared before the bishop himself, that they were very sorry they had created a bishop out of such a mean person. A great dispute arose, and after no small useless expense on both sides, an appeal was made to the presence of the pope, and Master Odo de Kinkelny was appointed advocate on behalf of the chapter. One day a remarkable circumstance occurred : as one of the canons, who favoured the cause of the chapter, was preaching to the people in that noble building the church of Lincoln, he laid a serious complaint before them all, of the oppressions of the bishop, and uttered the words, \" Even if we be silent, the Q stones will cry out,\" when, an these words were pronounced, a large portion of the church broke away and fell down.

The monks of Coventry, who had now arranged honourable terms for electing a bishop with the canons of the Lichfield church, after having, as before stated, by unanimous consent, elected William de Rsele, as their bishop, through fear, that, if they elected any other than a particukr favourite of the king, he would oppose them to their &ces\^ and would trouble them as usual, and whilst the said William still remained in a state of hesitation and suspense, and, like a man of prudence and experience, weighed future events in the scale of reason, the monks of Norwich, seeing that they had now waited a long time, because they had not elected the said William as their bishop, by which election they would not have offended the king, or any one else, at once met together and elected the said William de Raele as their bishop. The said William then rejected the other bishopric which he had gained by favour, and accepted that of Norwich ; for he preferred to remain in England with the English, rather than in Wales with the untamed Welsh. The fortification of the Tower qf London. In this same year, the Tower of London was strengthened, which the London citizens feared would tend to their injury ; but, on their making a complaint on the matter to the king, he replied that it was not done to their disgrace or danger ; \*\* But,\" said he, \"I will endeavour, henceforth, by the rebuilding\' of my castles, to imitate my brother, whom report declares to be more prudent than I am.\" The increasing animosity and hatred between the emperor and the pope. In Lent, of the same year, the pope, seeing the rash proceedings of the emperor, and that his words pleaded excuse for his sins, namely, that by the favouring assistance of some of the nobles and judges of Sardinia, he had taken into his own possession, and still held, the land and castles of the bishop of Sardinia, and constantly declared that they were a portion of the empire, that he by his first and chief oath would preserve the rights of the empire to the utmost of his power, and would also collect the scattered portions of it, was excited to the most violent anger against him, settmg

As the emperor, however, contumaciously refused his request, and excused his actions by arguments founded on reason, his holiness the pope, on Palm Sunday, in tne presence oi a great many of the cardinals, in the spirit of glowing anger, solemnly excommunicated the said emperor Frederick, as though he would at once have hurled him from his imperial dignity, consigning him with terrible denunciations to the possession of Satan at his death ; and making use of these words, and, as it were, thundering forth the ftiry of his anger, he excited terror in all his hearers. The excommufdcation pronounced against the emperor Frederick. \" In the name of the Almighty God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and by the authority of the apostles Peter and Paul, we excommunicate and anathematize the said Emperor Frederick, because he has raised a sedition against the Eoman church in the city, whereby he endeavours to drive the Eoman pontiff and his brethren from their see, and, in opposition to privileges, rank, and persons, to trample on the liberty of the Apostolic See, as well as of the church, in rash vioktion of the oath by which he is bound in this matter to the Eoman church. We also excommunicate and anathematize the said emperor, because he ordered some of his subjects to prevent our venerable brother the bishop of Prseneste, a legate of the Apostolic See, from proceeding in the legation which we had intrusted to him in the Albigensian provinces, for the confirmation of the Catholic faith. Again, we excommimicate and anathematize him, because he will not permit certain cathedral and other vacant churches in his kingdom to be

Again, we excommunicate and anathematize the said emperor, because in his kingdom clerks are seized and imprison\^ proscribed, and slain. Again, we excommunicate and anathematize him, because in his kingdom churches devoted to Grod are destroyed and pro&ned. Again, we excommunicate and anathematize him, because he does not allow the church of Sorano to be repaired. Again, we excommunicate and anathematize the said emperor, because, when the nephew of the king of Tunis was coming to the church of Kome to receive the sacrament of baptism, he detained him, and would not allow him to come. Again, we excommunicate and anathematize the said emperor, because he seized and detained in prison Peter the Saracen, a noble Roman citizen, when coming to the Apostolic See on behalf of the king of England. Again, we excommunicate and anathematize him, because he has taken possession of the lands of the church, namely, Ferrara, Pingnogoma\^ Bologna, the diocese of Ferrara, that of Bologna, and the diocese of Lucca, as well as the territory of Sardinia, in rash violation of the oath by which he is boimd to the church in this matter. Again, we excommunicate and anathematize him, because he has seized and ravaged the lands of some of the nobles of his kingdom, which the church held in her rule. Again, we excommunicate and anathematize him, because he has spoiled certain cathedral churches of their possessions, namely, those of Mont Royal, Cephelada, Catana, Squilata, and also the monasteries of Mileto, of St. Eufemia the Greater, and of St. John in Lamentano. Again, we excommunicate and anathematize the said emperor, because many cathedral and other churches and monasteries of his kingdom have been, by an unjust inquisition, deprived of almost all their possessions.

Again, we excommunicate and anathematize him, because the prelates of the churches and the abbats of the Cistercian and other orders in his kingdom, are obliged, every month, to give a certain sum of money towards the building of new castles. Agaiii, we excommunicate and anathematize the said emperor, because, contrary to the terms of the peace, those who adhered to the church were obliged to leave their country as proscribed men, whilst their wives and children were imprisoned. Again, we excommunicate and anathematize him, because it is by him that the crusade is impeded, as well as the restoration of the Homan empire. And all those who are bound by their oath of fealty to him, we decree are absolved from the observance of that oath, and strictly forbid them to observe their allegiance to him, so long as he is bound by the chain of excommunication ; and for his oppressions and other injuries inflicted on nobles, poor widows, orphans, and others of the kingdom, on whose behalf the said emperor Frederick has formerly sworn to abide by the commands of the church, we intend to depose him, and in this matter, with God\'s assistance, we will proceed, as we ought with justice to do. Moreover, for all and singular the above-mentioned offences, for which the said Frederic has been by us carefully and often admonished, although he did not trouble himself to obey us, we excommunicate and anathematize the said Frederick. Again, because the said Frederick is seriously defamed by these said deeds of his, many crying out, as it were, through the whole world, that he does not entertain right opinions respecting the Catholic faith, we, with God\'s assistance, will proceed in this matter at its proper time and place, according to the rules of the law.\" How the emperor\* 8 anger was kindled against the pope. The emperor, on hearing of this, was inflamed with violent anger, and with oft-repeated reproaches accused the church and its rulers of ingratitude to him, and of returning evil for good ; recalling to their recollection how he had exposed himself and his property to the billows and to a thousand

See what kind of protection is this of our father\'s ! What \^kind of assistance in difSculties is this afforded by the vicar of Jesus Christ 1 And now this persecutor\'s rage is not satisfied ; for he has, to confiise and destroy me, set up in opposition to me John de Brienne, formerly king of Jerusalem, whom he knew to be bold in war and skilled in military discipline, and to be my most bitter enemy, whilst I had no apprehension of thejkind. He has also enriched himself with a large sum o(\^mone§ which he has impudently extorted from the poor prelates of the churches throughout the world ; and it is not easy to disclose what sighs, what tears, this grief produced in my heart when I heard such things from my subjects ; but He knows who is ignorant of nothing. At once, however, concealing this heartfelt grief under a calm countenance, I began to treat for a peace, and a truce having been agreed on, I hastened ray return, lest our enemies should happen to learn this, and become proud in their exultation, and thence become more harassing to us. But when I returned home, I found my territory seized and occupied by the relatives and friends of the pope, the leader and chief of whom was the aforesaid John de Brienne ; these, however, I seized, and with Grod as my avenger, I punished those men who had obstructed the affairs of the cross according to their deserts. Let God judge between me, his soldier, and the pope, his vicar ; Christ knows, and the world knows, that I do not wander from the path of truth. This is the root and origin of his hatred.

This mountain was impregnable, and indeed inaccessible to any one unless at the will of the monks and others who dwelt on it ; however E. Guiscard, by a device pretending that he was dead, and being carried thither on a bier, thus took possession of the monks\' castle. When the pope heard this, he concealed his grief, and asked the reason ; to which the monks replied, \" Because, in obedience to you, we excommunicated the emperor.\" The pope then said, \"Your obedience shall save you;\" on which the monks went away without receiving \^/.\^( anything more from the pope. cai\^\'\^\'\*\^ A remarkable writing. In the same year there appeared to a certain monk of the Cistercian order, a white hand writing bodily the following words : --- \" The lofty cedar of Lebanon shall be cut down. Mars shall prevail over Saturn and Jupiter, and Saturn shall lay snares for Jupiter in all things. There shall \\nX \^ be one God, that is a monarch. The second God has come. \^ v/ The sons of Israel shall be released from captivity within eleven years. A certain people, considered to be without a chief, shall come in their wanderings. Alas for the clergy ; if it should fall, a new order flourishes ; alas for the faith of the church, of laws, and of kingdoms. Changes shall occur, and the whole Saracen nation shall be subverted.\" An eclipse of the sun. On the 3rd of June, in this year, there was an eclipse of the sun about the sixth hour of the day. About the same time of the year, William, bishoj) elect of Valentia, wa,s, by the intervention of the pope (who wished, it was said, to appoint him leader of his army against the emperor), caUed \\

Alas ! alas ! what / y a mass o\^jaongg\^ inclined the court o(\^SoES3bo give its consent and permission. The birth qf Edward the Firtt, eon of King Henry the Third. On the night of the 16th of June, a son was bom at Westminster to the king by his wife Eleanor. At this event all the nobles of the kingdom offered their congratulations, and especially the citizens of London, because the child was bom at London ; and they assembled bands of dancers, with drums and tambourines, and at night illuminated the streets with large lanterns. The bishop of Carlisle initiated the infant, and the legate baptized him, although he was not a priest, but Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, confirmed him, and at the wish of the king the name of Edward was given to him. A \^reat many messengers were sent to make known this event, who returned loaded with costly presents. \^ \' pAnd now the king deeply clouded his magnificence as a C\^ \^y king, for, as the messengers returned, the king inquired of K \' each what he had received, and those who had received least, although they brought valuable presents with them, he ordered to send them back with contempt ; nor was his anger appeased till each person had given satisfactory presents at the will of the messengers. Of this a certain Norman wittily remarked, --- \"Cod gave us this child, but the king sells him to us.\" The legate, too, not being sparing of the harvest which he had not sown, gratified the person who brought the news with presents at the cost of others. As I said before, this infant was baptized by the legate on the fourth day after his birth, and was lifted from the font by the bishops, Roger of London, and Walter of Carlisle ; and also by William, bishop elect of Norwich ; by Eichard, earl of Cornwall, the king\'s brother; and by the earls Simon de Montfort, of Leicester, and Hugh de Bohun, of Hertford and Essex ; and also by Simon the Norman, archdeacon of Norwich, and the noble Peter de Maulac, and Almaric de t /

A.D. 1239.\] NICHOLAS ELECTED BISHOP OF CHESTER. 173 St. Amand ; and in the presence of a gi\*eat many noble ladies. About this time Ealph de Thony, a noble baron, took leave of his friends, and departed for the crusades with a great many nobles, especially from the kingdom of France ; who, after great preparations, boldly set out on their journey to Jerusalem, that at the last day, when men are rewarded for their good deeds, they might be crowned with laurels, and obtain their eternal reward. The election of Master Nicholas of Famham as bishop qf Chester. In the same year, after William de Ksele had been called and elected to the government of the church of Norwich, with the consent of the clergy as well as the people, the monks of Coventry at once proceeded in the matter of electing some suitable pastor for themselves, that they might not be any more annoyed by an election deservedly to be censured. They therefore elected Master Nicholas, of Famham, a man of good learning, and, what was of more importance, one adorned by manifold virtues, of handsome stature, eloquent in discourse, and mature and modest in demeanour and conduct, so that no speck of censure could stand in the way of their intentions. But after the king, as well as the clergy and people, had accepted of him, Master Nicholas, as a man of profound reasoning, seeing that the affair was open to dispute by law, and that the bishopric was on the farthest borders of England, and considering, like a humble and discreet man, that he was incapable of sustaining such a great burden, and also that it would be perilous to him to undertake to render an account of the charge of so many souls, refiised, on any account, to accept of the offer, but firmly refrised to undertake the weight of office, and resigned the honour of it. For it was a matter of dispute between the monks and canons, because the canonical party affirmed that they ought to elect the bishop this time, according to the terms of the agreement, by which the dispute between them had been settled, namely, that after one election had been made by the monks, the second should devolve on the canonicals ; but when the canons put forth this claim, the monks replied, that the election having been annulled, had not come to any result, and that they had not gained their ends, owing to an unexpected

The canons, however, said, \" We would have you to know that it is not your elected bishop that displeases us, for he is quite competent to a superior station ; but the form of electing him displeases us, since the election devolved on us, not on you, and this we have well proved by our\^acts ; for we elected our dean as our bishop, and as the guardian of our souls.\" But when the soimd arose of a disturbance which threatened to bring on a destructive discord, the dean, a pious man, wishing to put an end to the disagreement, said aloud in public, \" Be it so, be it so ; I do not know on what grounds you have elected mo, who am quite inadequate to sustain the burden of the episcopal office; with my whole heart and mind I oppose such an election, and give it up : but let this disturbance be set at rest, and let us, for this time, all, with one consent, adhere to that good man of whom report speaks so well.\" Saving, however, the right of their church on both sides, they all, monks as well as canons, unanimously sent to the aforesaid Master Nicholas, informing him that all who had formerly disagreed, had now come to a unanimous determination, and had elected him, humbly begging of him graciously to accept of the honour, however burdensome, offered to him in the name and on behalf of the Lord. Master Nicholas, in reply to them then said, \" With clasped hands I return you manifold thanks, my friends and masters, both canons and monks, in whose eyes I was of such consequence, that you have elected me, such as I am, to be your pastor ; but, my friends, my present state suffices me, and the burden of the office now intrusted to me oppresses me heavily ; and the care and charge, as well as the accou\^it to be rendered of the souls intrusted to me, disturbs and alarms me. Cease, therefore, my beloved brethren, cease any longer to annoy me in this matter ; for I tell you plainly, whether you agree to it or not, I do not agree to this election.\" On hearing this, the others, according to the aforesaid form, took counsel, and elected as their bishop and guardian of their souls.

The sufferings of the Jews. In the same year, on the feast of St. Alban, the protomartyr of England, and on the following day, a great massacre and destruction of the Jews took place by order of Geoflfrey the Templar, a particular councillor of\^ the king, who oppressed, imprisoned them, and extorted\[!mQn£\^ &om them. At length, after great suffering, these wretched Jews, in order to enjoy life and tranquillity, to their own ruin and confusion, paid to the king a third part of all their money, debts as well as chattels. The original cause of this calamity was the perpetration of a clandestine murder committed by the Jews in the city ; and not long after this, owing to a boy having been circumcised by the Jews, four of the richest of that community, having been clearly convicted of the offence, were hung at Norwich. Ralph Briton is taken prisoner. In the course of the year in which God had, in accordance with the petition of the king, as well 8\^ the desire of many, amidst much exultation bestowed a male chUd on the king, as the cup of this life contains nothing unalloyed by the bitterness of gall, a certain messenger of the king\'s, named William, who had been convicted of manifold crimes, and had been condemned to death, and was lying in close confinement, rendered several of the nobles of England notorious by false accusations of treason ; amongst others he made a criminal accusation against Ralph Briton, a clergyman and canon of St. Paul\'s church at London, who had been some time since a familiar Mend of the king, and even his treasurer. The king, on hearing this, ordered him, by letters sent to the mayor of London, William Gromer (or Gerard Batt), to be seized and imprisoned in the Tower of London,

176 MATTHEW PARIS. \[a.D. 1230. \^ and the mayor, obeying him rather than God, at once carried \"tKe ting\'s orders into effect ; for he dragged the said Ralph with violence from his house in the neighbourhood of St. Paul\'s church, and imprisoned him in the Tower, securing him with chains, commonly called rings. The dean of London, Master G. de Lucy, when informed of this act, together with his feUow canons (because the bishop was not then present), pronounced a general sentence of excommunication against all the presumptuous perpetrators of this enormity, and placed St. Paul\'s chiux\^h under an interdict. The king, however, although warned by the bishop, did not correct his fistults, but continued with threats to heap evils on evils, on which the bishop was about to place the whole of the city of Iiondon, which was subject to him, under an interdict ; but when the archbishop of Canterbury, as well as the legate, the bishop of London, and many other prelates, were prepared to lay a heavy hand on the city, the king, although unwillingly, ordered the aforesaid Bialph to be released, and to be allowed to depart in peace ; but when he wished to add the condition that he should be kept so as to be ready to give an explanation when he, the king, chose to accuse him, the church replied that they would not, on any aocount, keep him in this manner like an imprisoned man, but that the church should receive him as absolutely fi\*ee, as when the king\'s attendants forcibly tore him fi-om his house. In this manner, then, was Ealph released, who being taught by experience with what fickleness fortune tames her followers, withdrew, after this chastening, from the king\'s court. Stephen Segrave, although he had often suffered a like oppression, mixed himself up, notwithstanding his age, in the affairs of the court, and at this time became the chief councillor of the king, and by his innate skiU began to keep a more than usual restraint on the king\'s plans. Shortly afterwards, the above-mentioned villain, who had, as above stated, calumniated the nobles, and the aforesaid Ealph, was ignominiously himg outside the city of London on that instrument of punishment called a gibbet ; and when he saw that his death was certain, he, although late, openly confessed before the people and his executioners, that he had made the aforesaid false accusations only for the purpose of prolonging his life.

About this time, by command of the pope, the said emperor Frederick was denounced as excommunicated in St. Paul\'s church, at London, as likewise throughout the whole of the bishopric of London, and afterwards throughout the whole kingdom ; and there was no one to put forth the shield of opposition, although the king had good grounds for opposing it, before all the princes of the world, on account of the near relationship existing between him and the emperor. Letters from the emperor to the senate and people qfRome. In the. same year, his majesty, the emperor, wondering that the strength of the Romans was so greatly weakened, and that they recoiled from the firmness of their due subjection and faithfully promised allegiance to him, permitting the sentence of excommunication to be pronounced against him, their natural lord, in their own city, wrote to the cardinals of the court of Rome, as well as to the senators of the city and the inhabitants, as follows : --- \" Frederick, by the grace of God, emperor of the Romans, ever Augustus, king of Jerusalem and SicUy, to the senator of the \' city and his fellow Romans, Greeting. --- Since Rome is the head and authoress of our empire, and the emperor is called Roman ft\'om the name of the city Rome, and as we owe to it the advancement and prestige of our name and honour, we are lost in astonishment that where our honour is to be promoted, and insults to be repelled, we should, amongst those who are bound and whose duty it is to put themselves forward as a wall of defence to our imperial throne, meet with contrary treatment, whilst they themselves hear and conceal the facts. Wherefore, we are greatly grieved that the Roman bishop, as it is reported, has dared to act in the city against the Roman prince, in a manner in which he would not dare to act elsewhere ; and has impiously blasphemed the Roman emperor, the founder of the city, and the benefactor of the Roman people, without any resistance on their parts ; so that we may truly say that the nobles, as well as the Roman people, for whom we have studied to make provision with a liberal and voluntary munificence, and for the continued advajatage of whom we are still striving, have been VOL.

For by letters patent of the prelates, whom the apostolic mandate has appointed as monitors, evidence of the same kind is given ; and our preceding decree concerning the recall of the prelates who have suffered injuries, and of making full reparation to those prelates, now gives plain evidence to the truth by letters of the venerable archbishop of Messina, sent to our assessor, appointed for this purpose : wherefore, it is not without good cause that we lament that the apostolic father endeavours so seriously to offend us ; and when snch a great injury &lls on a brave man, although we should wish to endure it patiently, the enormity of the offence does not allow us to do so ; but thft k2

But aitliougli neither he nor the whole race who will sutfer on this account are of such importance that the imperial dignity would thirst for vengeance upon them ; and because the authority of the see lets loose the reins of its authority, and the whole community of the venerable brethren may seem to favour it in its pertinacity, the disturbance pains our mind, because, whilst we defend ourselves from the persecutor, we ought in defending ourr selves more severely to attack those who oppose us, saving in all respects the sanctity of the church, which we worship with holy worship and due reverence ; wherefore, we earnestly beseech your venerable community, out of your deliberate moderation, to check the proceedings of the supreme pontiff, which from evident causes the world knows to be not so just as gratuitous, and to provide for the general condition and present peace of our minds. For though we are favourably bound to promote the well-doing of you all, yet we cannot with evenness of mind abstain frt)m offence at injuries done us ; nay, though we may not be able to check beginnings, yet injuries, which cannot be recalled, may justly be repelled by other injuries.

One of these writings was as follows : --- \" Eome shall be excited C\\ against Boman, and a Boman substitute shall diminish Bome from the Boman. The rods of shepherds shall become light, and their comfort shall be in rest. The careful will

The expectations of the confident are destroyed, and the comfort which produces confidence is at rest. Those who walked in darkness will return to light ; and the things which were separated and scattered abroad will be consolidated. A large cloud will begin to rain, because a changer of the world is bom. The lamb shall be substituted for the lion ; and l/\^ lambs shall prey on lions. Madness shall rise against the simple minded, and simplicity shall breathe attenuated. Honour shall be converted into disgrace, and the joy of the many will become grief\" These words, spoken in the year of graceCjll\^ were understood to mean that the said threats were already impending. Another writing, which the emperor seems to have procured, is nevertheless said to have been the truth : that the. following verses were found written in the pope\'s bedroom; but how it was done, or who wrote them, is not known : --- Fata docent, stellseque monent, aviumque volatos : Totius mundi malleus unus erit. Roma diu titubans variis erroribus acta, Totius mundi desinet esse caput. \[The stars and fates, and flight of birds decree, That all this world of ours shall hammered be : Rome totters, through a mass of errors led, And of the world shall cease to be the head.\] As the emperor and many others interpreted these verses as redounding to the ruin and desolation of the pope and the Roman court, his holiness retorted by the following verses against the emperor : --- Fama refert, Scriptura docet, peccata loquuntur\^ Quod tua vita brevis ; poena perennis erit. \[Fame, Scripture, and your sins do loudly tell, You\'ll, after death, for ever smart in hell.\] The emperor exculpates himaelf hy monitors.

But we, as in duty bound, yet doubting whether he would receive our warnings with patience, went to him with respect and devotion, and after explaining each of the points contained in these chapters, and having given him a copy of our letters, by the grace of God, who rules and directs the hearts of kings at will, he, with wonderful devotion and unexpected humility, showed himself ready to listen to our admonitions, and the ears of his imperial highness were inclined to us. When we appeared before him, there being also present the archbishops of Palermo and Messina, and the bishops of Cremona, Lodi\^ Novara, and Modena, and the abbats of St. YincentX besides several of the Preachers and Minorite brethren who had been convoked by him, he replied to our propositions one by one, as is fiilly and distinctly contained in the following lines, as, according to the apostolic mandate, we inform you by these presents, and are prepared to attest the truth o£ \" Proposition of the Chwrch : --- \^The churches of Mont Royal, Cephaledi, Catania, and Squillata, and the monasteries of Mileto, St. Euphemia, Terra-maggiore, and St. John in Lama, have been despoiled of almost all their property ; also, almost all the cathedral and other churches and monasteries have, by an unjust inquisition, been deprived of almost all their dependants. The emperor\^s anstver : --- \^With respect to the injuries to the churches, which are put forth indefinitely, some which have been committed through ignorance, have been ordered to be remedied, without delay, and some have been already corrected, as is evident from the report of our \^ithful and industrious messenger, Master William de

On entering the kin\^piom, he found in those parts some things which were held by some of the imperial retainers, and to them he showed no mercy, but immediately despoiled them, and restored those who had been despoiled by them, although he was ordered to take from the imperial exchequer whatever he &und to be illegally obtained ; so that when the report of what he had done reached the court of Rome, the pope is said to have approved of the foresight of the sender, as well as the diligeuce of the person sent ; but as the kingdom was divided into provinces, he could not travel through them all, to amend what he thought necessary. Again, in answer to the charge respecting the church of Mont Royal, he stated that it had received no injury at the hands of the emperor, unless he wished to refer to the Saracens, who had seized on the property of the church during war, and that they recognised neither the church nor the emperor, and spai\^ed nothing that came in their power ; yea, that they had destroyed and pillaged that church to the bare walls, and spared not any one in Sicily, so that in that island there remained few Caiiiatians, if any. The emperor, indeed, confesses that he has utterly extermmated these people from Sicily, at much trouble and expense, if they consider that an injury to the church ; and he does not know that he has ever harmed it in any other way, nor does he wish to injure it. He says the same also with regard to the church of Cephaledi, unless reference is made to the castle of Cephaledi, which, being the best fortified citadel on the seacoast, and standing on the frontiers of the Saracens, the kings of Sicily have always held ; and pope Innocent, of good memory, gave orders to his legate, who was then in Sicily on our service, to receive it from the bishop, into whose hands it had fallen by disturbances, and not by right, and that the legate had caused it during our childhood to be held and kejt for us, nor was it restored to that bishop or the present one, nor ought it to be restored, for they had no right to it ; and besides that, he was convicted on clear

Also, with regard to the church of Catana, he says the same, unless the men of the emperor\'s demesne are referred to, who, in time of war, went to Catana, on account of the security and fertility of the place. The emperor acknowledges that he had recalled them to his own demesne, according to the terms of the general constitution of the kingdom, by which earls and barons and all the vassals of the kingdom recal the men of their demesne wherever they find theSt, whether on the lands of the churches, or in the citi\^ of the emperor. Nevertheless, a form has been decreed in this matter, and a limited time fixed and accepted at the request of the supreme pontiff, as appears from the testimonial letters of the Patriarch of Antioch, and of the archbishops of Palermo and Messina. Again, in the case of the churches of Mileto and St. Euphemia, although a suitable change had been effected with the abbats and monks of Terra-maggiore, at the wish of the prelates themselves, and the conventual assemblies, according to the form of law, they themselves, to this day, hold and possess the property exchanged. But the village of St. Severius, which did not at all belong to the abbat of Terra-maggiore of Ancona, but had there some rights which it held in fee of the emperor, was, after a trial, destroyed with just cause, because the inhabitants of that place, during the disturbances, slew one Paul of Longothan, a king\'s standard-bearer, and carried off the emperor\'s cattle ; and, nevertheless, as has been stated, an exchange was given to the abbat and conventual assembly on their behalf, and they hold it to this day. The place, Lama, is enclosed according to sentence by the abbat of St, John the Round, who might justly, according to civil and canonical law, be convened for it, as for a good feudal property, in the imperial court. \" Proposition of the Church : --- The Templars and Hospitallers have been despoiled of their moveable property, as well as fixtures, and have not been restored completely, according to the terms of the peace.

Other feudal and burgage-lands were, however, allowed to them, as they had obtained and held them previous to the death of King WiDiam the second, or of which they had a grant from any of his predecessors. But some burgage-lands, which they bought, were revoked from them, according to the terms of the ancient constitution of Sicily, because no grant of burgage-lands can be made amongst the living without the consent of their prince, nor can they be bequeathed by a last will, without being bound to sell or grant to other secular burgesses, after the lapse of a year, a month, a week, and a day. This decree was made of old for the following reason, that if they were allowed freely and perpetually to buy or receive burgagelands, in a short time they would buy the whole kingdom of Sicily, which would seem of all the provinces of the world to suit them best, and this same constitution is in force beyond sea. \" Proposition of the Church : --- Also, that he does not allow cathedral and other vacant churches to be filled up ; and by this, the liberty of the church is endangered, feith dies, and, in the absence of a pastor, there is no one to set forth the word of Grod, and to govern their souls. The emperor, in reply, states. That he wishes and desires cathedral and other churches to be ordained, saving the privileges and dignities which the kings his predecessors had enjoyed up to his own time, and which he had till now used much more moderately than his predecessors ; and he was never opposed to the filling up of churches. \" Proposition of the Chwrch : --- Concerning talliages and exactions which are extorted from the churches and monasteries, contrary to the terms of the peace. 2\'he emperor\^8\\ reply : --- Talliages, and taxes collected from ecclesiastical per- / sons, are imposei\^ not for church property, but for feudal 1 and patrimonial estates, according to the common law ; \\ and this is in force in all parts of the world. -\^

With respect to proscribed ones, he knows that some have been banished the kingdom for the crime of treason. As to any who had been slain, he knows that, owing to the exemption of clerks and monks from punishment, the church of Venusium mourns the death of their prelate, who was slain by one of his own monks ; and, in St. Vincent\'s church, monk slew monk, and no vengeance or canonical punishment for the offence followed. \" Proposition of the ChtJi/rch : --- Begarding the profanation and destruction of churches consecrated to God.

It must, however, be remembered, that, when the terms of peace were arranged, the pope, contrary to those terms, and in opposition to the opinion of almost all the brethren, detained the city of Castellana ; for the retention of which, to the injury of the empire, he received (\^one\^ whilst he, the emperor, was in his service against the Romans ; in which cause he expended more than a himdred thousand marks of silver, and the church obtained great advantages, as well from the territory which was taken from the Romans and restored to it, as from the restoration of the liberty of the church in the city, on the plea of the aforesaid service. \" Proposition of the Church : --- Respecting the nephew of the king of Tunis, that he did not permit him to come to the Apostolic See to receive the sacrament of baptism, but detained him a prisoner. The emperor replies, --- That the nephew of the king of Tunis fled from Barbaiy into Sicily, not to be baptized, but to escape death, with which he was threatened by his uncle ; that he was not kept a prisoner, but went at liberty, through Apulia, and, on being asked if he wished to be baptized, he altogether denied it. I\^ however, he is willing to be baptized, the emperor hears it with pleasure, as he has stated elsewhere in this matter\^ to the archbishops of Palermo and Messina. \" Proposition of the Chv/rch : --- With respect to Peter the Saracen, a faithfrd servant of the church, whom he detains prisoner to the injury of the church, and also with regard to brother Jordan, who is also kept prisoner. The emperor replies, --- That Peter the Saracen has been made prisoner by him as an enemy, and slanderer of him, both in the city and elsewhere ; also, that he came not on the business of the English king, but only brought letters from him, entreating us, if he should happen to be taken prisoner, to show mercy to the prisoner ; but we did not pay attention to them, for that king did not know what treachery the said

188 MATTHEW PARIS. \[a.D. 1239. Peter had plotted against me. With respect to brother Jordan, the emperor states that he did not seize him, or order him to be seized, although he had defsuned him in his sermons, but because it appeared to some of his subjects that his position and stay in the marches of Treviso and Lombardy would be injurious to the emperor; but that, after he had given security that he would not remain in the marches, or in Lombardy, he, the emperor, ordered him to be released and given over to the archbishop of Messina, if he would receive him on the same terms as have been here mentioned. \" Proposition of the Ghwrch : --- That he had excited a disturbance in the city against the church, by which he was endeavouring to expel the Roman pontiff and his brethren from their see, and, in opposition to the privileges, dignities, and honours of the Apostolic See, to trample on the liberty of the church. The emperor , in reply, denies that any disturbance was excited in the city against the church by him ; but, as he had Mth\^ subjects in the city, as his predecessors, both Roman princes and kings of Sicily, were accustomed to have, because sometimes the senators elected by the power of their enemies, strove to offend them, he stood forward in their defence, as he would do in the like cases as often as was expedient. But when the cause ceased, namely, when another senator was elected by common consent, the above-mentioned disturbance ceased, as appears from the evidence of the matter itself according to the testimony of the archbishops of Palermo and Messina. \" Proposition of the Ghwrch : --- \^That he gave orders to some of his subjects for the detention of the bishop of Prseneste, the legate of the Apostolic See. The emperor replied, --- That with regard to the order for the detention of the bishop of Praeneste, he never ordered, nor even dreamt of such a thing, although he could have justly done so to him as his enemy ; who although sent by the pope as a religious man, yet, by the pope\'s command, as he said, he craftily and perniciously, in a great measure stirred up all Lombardy against him, the emperor, and encouraged the Lombards to oppose him to the utmost of his power.

The emperor\'s reply : --- With regard to the matter of Lombardy, the emperor said, that he had many times referred it to the church, but had never obtained any advantage thereby, unless that, on the first occasion, the Lombards were condemned to supply four hundred knights, whom the pope ordered to be furnished to him in such a way that he sent them into the kingdom against the emperor himself. On the second occasion, they were mulcted in five hundred soldiers, whom he ordered to be sent, not to the emperor, against whom the ofifence had been committed, but to be sent beyond sea, under the protection and at the demand of the pope and the church, which was not offended ; and yet even this was never done. On the third occasion, at the request of the cardinals, namely, the ex-bishop of Sabinum, and Master Peter, of Capua, to whom the pope had given full powers, the said business was referred to the church, and there never after was a word said about the matter, unless when the pope learnt that the emperor, after having often been deceived ,by him, was preparing to descend with his army fi:om Grermany into Italy, and then he earnestly begged for the matter to be again intrusted to him ; and the emperor, although he had often suffered shipwreck in intrusting this said matter to the same person, was yet willing to refer it to him on a certain day, on condition that it was confirmed to his own honour, and the advantage of the empire. This condition, however, the pope, as appears by his letters, refused to accept, although now he says in his letters, that the church was prepared to determine the business, so as to maintain the right and honour of the empire ; and from this it appears that the pope and his letters most flatly contradict one another. And that it may not be alleged that the emperor wishes to renew his claims on Italy, to the prejudice of the Holy Land, how his lordship the emperor took the cross, and afterwards did not neglect what he had undertaken, appears by his letters in reply,

Finally, as has been before stated, a notary of the emperor\^s was sent as a special messenger to repair the injuries inflicted on the Church. The emperor, moreover, added in reply, that, what was more irregular, and would excite the wonder and astonishment of all who heard it, after the departure of the before-mentioned archbishops of Palermo and Messina, to whom the pope had promised to extend the fevour of the church, on the emperor\'s behalf\^ and had stated that he wished to have one and the same interests with him, the emperor himself as became him, making no small exertion to effect this ; and, after a sufficient answer had been given to the said archbishops, concerning certain points set forth by them, as appears by their attestations, these letters were sent, and those heads were enclosed to the prelates, behind the backs and to the con\^sion of the said archbiEJiops, as they were entirely ignorant of this having been done ; and these letters, although they coittained a sort of warning, yet contained evident aspersions on the emperor\'s &me. Lsstlj, the emperor, as a general reply, alleges that, although he was absent from the kmgdom and was ignorant of the state of it, he will give orders for whatever injuries have been inflicted on the church (which remain to be shown), to be entirely repaired without any dispute. Nevertheless that, for the general good, whidi results from union between him and the church, he is prepared to give to the church all the protection which becomes the church and the empire ; that for the honour and exaltation of the Christian &ith, and to preserve the honour and liberty of the church, he will do his best that he and it may be one.

He also caused the sentence which had been pronounced against the said emperor, to be oolemnlj published throughout all the countries which were obedient to him, and especially throughout England, and seriously defio\^ed him, by declaring him to be an open enemy of God and the church. News of this soon reached the emperor, on which he was greatly grieved, and wrote to his friends as foUows, laying heavy complaints against the pope :--- The emperor\* 9 letter. \" Frederick, d&c. d&c. --- \^We speak unwillingly, but cannot hold our peace ; for the axe has now been laid at the root of the tree, and the sword, piercing almost to the soul, has loosed our Ups.

This design was, however, changed, owing to the fickleness of counsel and the continual disturbed state of ai&irs at that time ; but we, not wishing to abandon such a good intention, after again holding a conference with the pope at Ferentino, appointed a court to be held at Cremona, to which we summoned our son and a great many of the chiefe of our empire, with a suitable retinue of knights, and we nevertheless brought with us such an array of knights from the Italian provinces as was befitting the honour of the imperial dignity, and such a great matter. From this time the Lombards, rebelling against us and our honour, in a spirit of opposition and reprobate feeHngs, and making a pretence of fear because we were attended by armed men, have reftised to obey us as their legitimate lord, and by obstructing the roads hindered our ingress into Italy, and have removed our son and chiefs from our sight. To increase their as yet concealed wickedness and perfidy, they added malice and open insolence, for in their plots against us and the empire, they, in spite of our being present amongst them, formed neferious conspiracies. Being thus baulked in our expectation of seeing our son, we returned into Apulia, because we were then pressed for time, to make our preparations for the passage over the sea, to which we were bound by our vow ; and we intrusted this matter, with respect to satisfaction being made to us and to the empire, to be determined by the decision of the supreme pontifl\^ by whose award they were condemned to supply to us, at their own expense, five himdred soldiers for the service of the Holy Laiid. At first, sowing discord between the church and the empire, they sent them into Apulia against us, and thus, by a perverse mode of satisfaction, they redoubled their former injuries. When, however, we returned from the transmarine provinces, and the dispute between us and the church had been settled, we still adhered to our purpose of reforming the condition of the empire, and, by the advice of our most holy father Gregory, the supreme pontiff, we appointed a general court to be held at Ravenna, and proceeded thither with only our domestic retinue, and unarmed, that all frivolous causes of fear through the presence of armed men,

They also prevented our son\'s coming to us, as well as us from going to him, through the territory and by the roads of the empire (which, although they are their own, are yet common to all), so that the father\'s eye could not look on the son, unless, urged on by paternal affection, which cannot be restrained, we trusted ourselves to the dubious chances of a sea passage, and went to Aquileia, for the purpose of seeing our beloved son and the chiefe, who, in their devotion had come to us. The firmness of our clemency did not even then fail us, but laying aside all anger on account of the aggressions of our enemies, we again intrusted the determination of this matter to the church. But we raised in them the horns of disobedience instead of holding forth to them, as we had intended, examples of humanity ; they gave us perfidy instead of the fidelity due to us, and contempt instead of devotedness ; nor did any annoyance about the aforesaid matters give them understanding.\" Appearance of a comet. In the same year, on the eve of the feast of St. James, about dusk, before the stars had appeared, was seen in a clear blue sky, a very large star like a torch, which rose from the south, and fiying along, not upwards, darted through the air, making its way towards the north, not swiftly, but as a hawk usually files : when it had reached the middle of the firmament, which is in our hemisphere, it vanished, leaving, however, smoke and sparks in the air.

About the same time, namely, on the 9th of August, some noble ladies came to London to accompany the queen to the monastery for her purification, as was the custom.

The king, however, at once ordered them to be forcibly ejected, and, although they returned to the king, begging his pardon with tears and lamentations, they could not appease his anger ; for, said he, \" you seduced my sister before marriage, and when I found it out, I gave her to you in marriage, although against my will, in order to avoid scandal ; and, that her vow might not impede the marriage, you went to Rome, and by costly presents and great promises yoa bribed the Roman court to grant you permission to do what was unlawful.

The legate goes into Scotland, At this time, the legate made preparations for a speedy departure to Scotland, and after making the necessary arrangements, and having dispatched I\^glish guides to explore if any treachery was being planned against him, he took his journey thither, choosing sumptuous lodgings in the abbacies and cathedral churches, before, however, he entered the Scotch territories, he was met by the king of that country, who was not pleased with his entering his kingdom ; for he said that no legate, with the exception of him alone, had ever entered Scotland, nor was there any need, as he declared, for his doing so/ as Christiamty flourished there, and the church was in a prosperous state. At length, as arguments multiplied, and the king was almost excited to forbid his coming into the kingdom, a written agreement was drawn up by the intercession of some of the nobles of both kingdoms between them, the tenor of which was that such a custom should never become a matter of course on account of his coming there, and that, moreover, he should sign this writing at his departure ; and this was so arranged that he might not return to England in confusion and like a rejected man. He did not, however, cross the sea, but remained in the nchcities on this side of the sea, where he \'\'arranged aU ecclesiastic J\^ matters at will, and collected no small amount of money; after which, whilst the king remamed in the interior of the country, he took his departure clandestinely, and without the king\'s peridission, takm\^lE\^\" aforesaid written agreement with him.

But he seems to have lost the benefit of the care bestowed on his person, and the toils which the church underwent in his behalf, since he is unmindful of so many benefits, and imgrateful for such great favours. And would that he did not pass the bounds of even ingratitude, by which he would be content with a denial of his having received these benefits.

And although the Apostolic See loves him, and has raised him to the summit of secular power, yet owing to his urgent sins, for which, although ofben admonished by us, he has refiised to atone, we are compelled, however unwillingly, to rebuke Mm. For, although Divine Providence\^ raised up(A\^\^ to a height of dignity and power, and placed all the living things of the earth in subjection to Mm, yet, because he exceeded the commands of his Maker, his faults were not spared. The returns which the church has received\^ from the aforesaid Frederic, for all the benefits conferred, we do not wish you to be ignorant of, and in this present letter we set forth a few examples out of the many. In the city he has excited a serious dkturbance, endeavouring, by all the means in his power, to exclude us and our brethren therefrom ; thus bringing dishonour on the ApostoHc See, and trampling on the Uberty of the church itself, and rashly violating the oaths he has taken. He caused our venerable brother, the bishop of Praeneste, to be obstructed on his journey by some of Ms subjects, when we sent that prelate to the Aibigensian provinces for the strengthening of the Catholic faith. On no account will he allow cathedral and other vacant churches of his kingdom to be filled up, to the peril and serious injury of their souls, but, nevertheless, despoils them and others of all their possessions, and levies talHages and unjust imposts on prelates, religious men, and other secular clerks. Nobles, poor people, orphans, and widows, are reduced to the extreme of destitution, and the cruel and harsh severity of his extortionists does not allow them the least breathing space, and he has thus, as far as he could, reduced, as it were, to ashes and cinders, his whole kingdom, wMch is the spiritual patrimony of St. Peter, and for wMch he is bound by an oath of fealty to the Apostolic See, and is its vassal ; and since he has not, after having been warned by us, thought proper to amend his proceedings, we shall, with God\'s assistance, act in the matter as we shall see proper. Besides this, he impede\^ the cause of the Holy Land and of the Eoman empire ; and although, at the time when peace was re-established between him and the church, he swore, at the hands of the legates of the Apostolic See, to M •\\\\ \\ \\C\* Y9-\^\'

Again, this said emperor is detaining a prisoner, \^\^ the nephew of the king of Tunis, who was coming to the court and church of Rome to receive the rites of baptism ; as also our beloved son, Peter the Saracen, a noble Roman \^\"i\^ citizen, who was sent to us on the part of our beloved son in Christ, the illustrious king of England, to the Apostolic See, as also the son of the said Peter. Although he has been ofttimes admonished by us, he does not feel the remedy of correction, as the ulcers of his offences are become hardened, and he daily presumes to commit worse crimes ; we, therefore, being unable any longer, without offence to Christ, to pass over these things in silence, by the advice of our brethren, and in the name of the Almighty. God (whose vic\^erent we are on earth), by the authority of the blessed Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, however unwilling we may be, have thought fit to promulgate the sentence of excommunication and anathema against the said emperor Frederic, consigning him to Satan, that by the death of his body, on the day of the Lord, his soul may be saved. All who are bound to him by an oath of allegiance, we decree to be absolved from the observance of this oath, and strictly forbid them to abide by their fealty to him, as long as he continues bound by the chain of excommunication. Wherefore we warn and exhort you on your devotion, and by these apostolic letters command you to cause the aforesaid sentence of excommunication and anathema to be solemnly published on each Sunday and feast day, with bells ringing and candles burning, and in like manner to cause the said absolution and prohibition to be published and annoimced throughout the whole province of your legation ; and to fulfil our commands

Again, since the aforesaid Frederic has become notorious for other great and heavy crimes, we, by God\'s grace, will proceed in those matters in their proper time and place, as the nature of the case requires. However, as the noise of terror is always soimding in the ears of the wicked, and they suspect treachery even when it is peace, because the disturbed conscience always forbodes evU, the said Frederick, even before sentence of excommunication had been pronounced against him, determined to send some letters to our brethren, which letters are in part mentioned before, and which came to our knowledge and to theirs after the said sentence had been issued. Wherefore, as the Lord, who lays open the hidden things of darkness, and reveals the secrets of all hearts, wished to disclose the hidden thoughts of his heart, we gather from the purport of these letters what kind of devotion he feels towards the Boman church, his mother ; what reverence or respect he has for the supreme pontiff and his brethren and the Apostolic See, whose vassal he is in respect of his kingdom ; for he seems to have conspired against us and them, from which it is sufficiently shown what kind of, and how great a crime he has committed. Amongst other things contained in his letter, these words are inserted, \* Wherefore we grieve, not without just cause, that the apostolic father endeavours so seriously to injure us, for, when such a great injury falls on a firm man, although we may wish to endure it patiently, the enormity of the offence does not permit us to do so, but the violence of the deed impels us to take the vengeance which the Csesars were accustomed to practise.

Those who werelfesieged met with no mercy7\~and although they begged of the legate, with tears, that, if they gave up their cities and property entirely into their hands, their persons alone might be spared in God\'s name, they were not listened to unless they submitted themselves and their property to him entirely and iconditionally.

For taking his opportunity, when to avoid imminent scandal after taking the oath, the sentence of excommunication pronounced against us, we bound ourselves to cross within a certain time to the Holy Land ; then, because we were delayed by ill-health (adding many other charges respecting which we had never been forewarned or admonished), he, contrary to the wish of God and to justice, altogether rejected our excuses, as liable to excommunication. To this we submitted with all humility, as though it had been in the first instance pronounced at our wish, praying for absolution, and promising that, when our our former bodily health was restored, we would prepare instantly to make our passage. Though our himible petition was insultingly denied, we crossed to its rescue, in pious ftdfilment of our vow, thinking that the vicar of Jesus Christ aimed at the fulfilment of this matter rather than the gratification of his hatred against us. But he, who we hoped savoured only of things which are above, and who we supposed contemplated heavenly things with his eye, and dwelt upon them in thought, was found all at once to be a person not only void of truth, by his deeds of cruelty, but even cut off \\ from all feelings of humanity. For besides the hindrances which he threw in our way in Syria, by his messengers and legates, inasmuch as by letters fi:om him, --- \^the bearers of which we seized, and which letters we keep as evidences, --- they warned the sultan not to yield to us the land which was devoted to divine worship and the laws of the kingdom of Jerusalem ; he made forcible entry into our kingdom of Sicily, alleging, as a reason to do so, that R., son of the former duke of Spoleto, was preparing to enter the lands of the church, though this was without our consent or privity, as we afterwards made evident by punishing him. Nor did they proceed as holy men have done, and conquer kingdoms by faith, but by perfidy and perjury, to all ; or, if there were any who could not be tempted to perjury by the simple assertion, yet were these, too, immediately tempted ; when the very commanders of the papal forces, that they

Again, on our return firom beyond the seas, we simply repelled the wrong put upon us, abstaining from all attempts to avenge ourselves in accordance with the proud custom of our empire, and then willingly lent our ears to the words of peace, which mediators advanced. We know that, from our acknowledgment of the Catholic faith, we have found a true mother in the church ; but our father we have always found falsa For on the very day of our reconciliation, devising a plan for our rui\^ he most earnestly advised us to return into Italy with an uoaimed and private retinae, assigning as his r\^son, the fear that we should give occasion for alarm to our fidthfdl subjects if accompanied as before by an armed escort ; besides which, he declared that he would make everything secure for us. At the same time, he manifestly contrived the very contrary of this by letters and messages, as is evident from the testimony of many of our fSaithfiil subjects who were at the time privy to evei\^thing, as though they were sharers in these plots, and also from other chiefs of that party. Wherefore, as the public roads were everywhere stopped by our rebellious subjects against our son and some of our chiefs, who were coming to us from Grermany ; and, moreover, as our said son, when at Aquileia, and bound thenoe io Germany, with difficulty regained the protection of his ships, we were forced to return to our kingdom, as the advice, or rather cunning device, of our father, had sent us unprepared to check the wicked rebellion of our subjects. And here, again, when we were in some measure breathing more freely, and taking repose after our laboui\'s, our holy father invaded our quiet, taking upon himself the character of counsellor, and urging us most vehemently to proceed with vigour against the Romans who were devoted to us, and other rebellious subjects of ours in Tuscany, who were withholding the rights of the church and empire, trusting securely to his favour, because he wished to share with us our own and the the empire\'s burdens. In accordance, therefore, with his earnest advice, it behoved us to proclaim war on behalf of the church against the Bomans, who were at that time attacking Viterbo, whilst he was sending secret letters to the city to the effect, that we were acting thus from hatred

Meantime, a sedition having arisen in Sicily, we were obliged to visit Messina, that we might oppose, in its early stages, a faction that was forming there, giving as our sole reason, that we were unwilling to lose our noble island of Sicily ; on which occasion, without asking our advice, indeed, keeping the whole matter from our knowledge, against the law of nations, which decides that those who are allies and sharers in the same enterprise should not desert one another, he made a treaty with the Bomans, against whom we had proclahned war at his bidding, as above stated ; and this, too, without giving heed to the feet that, not without some risk and peril to our honour, we remained defenceless amongst rebellious and seditious subjects, and had sent a numerous and strong force to his assistance, though we were unable to be present in person. In addition to this, since the uprightness of our conscience, and the sincere devotion which we felt towards the church, our mother, did not allow the son to notice the unnatural follies of his father, we attributed to chance what belonged to craft ; and we were continually willing to refer the settlement of the reparation due to us to the arbitration of this stepfether, who on every occasion deceived us more grossly, mocked us more bitterly, in proportion as his promises of a full arbitration were more unhesitating. In the mean time, when, judging from our past differences, no hope, or, at least, but little, remained to us of settling the afi\^iirs of Italy to the honour of the empire, by means of the pope ; and when we were expecting the same persecution, at a time whilst we were thus waiting, all at once we thought that fortune had smiled upon us, for the quarrel between the church and the Bomans began afresh ; and in it we were so nobly and devotedly lavish of our treasures, and exposed our person, that we believed we had entirely removed the rust of an evil conscience fr\^m the hearts of our ill-wishers. Not content with all this, as we desired to offer to the church indisputable security as to our feelings, inflamed with the warmth of the fullest devotion towards it, as well as by the incentives of perfect charity in God, we went, in person, before this supreme pontiff, even without summons, taking with us our deaxBon Conrad, now elected king of the Bomans, and the heir

And after presenting our person to the church, we did not think it beneath us to offer this, our son, as a full hostage to the supreme pontiff, asking with all humility, and calling on God to bear witness to our sincerity, for a complete union between ourselves and the church, such as this prelate of the general church had long ago, when he was bishop of Ostia, persuaded us it was our duty to seek. On all which accounts\^ as the offer, which has been mentioned, procured for us favourable countenance on the part of the whole court, and as thankful speeches appeared to show the sincere good-will, as much of the supreme pontiff as of those of all his court, thinking that we had managed everything with them by the proposal of our holy intention, and not less in reliance upon our submissiveness, we thought proper, with prompt devotion, to explain the cause of the differences between ourselves and the Lombards, which had been so often stifled in the breast of a corrupt judge, and the settlement of the discord between ourselves and the citizens and nobles of Ancona. Thus feeling sure of a favourable consummation of all our affairs, we proceeded in person, with good-will to the service of the church, with a numerous army which, by heavy payments from our treasury, we had caused to be collected from the parts of Grermany, as well as Italy. Nor did we desist from the prosecution of our purpose before that our power had restor\^ to its former and proper condition the liberty of the church, which had been trodden under foot in the city and its territory, which had been seized on outside it, thinking it to be beyond doubt that the submissiveness of our devotion would earn for us what the fevour due to our justice had been imable to gain. But listen ye, to the wonderM return which, for our great devotion, our numerous benefits, our confirmation of such undoubted feith, this vicar of Christ, this shepherd of our Catholic church, this preacher of the faith endeavoured to make to us in each case.

Nor did he suffer us to go with the soldiers, which, as we said, we were keeping in those parts to defend the provinces of the church, nor would he send any messenger or letters, owing to which there ensued, in the pitched battles which took place, immense slaughter of men and burnings of churches. Again also, not contented with such great and uncommon baseness, when we were staying with him at Reate, and expending many thousand marks on his cause, he refused to give up to us the city of Castella, which was taken by him at the commencement of the quarrel, as he was bound to do by the terms of peace, and advised to by all his brethren, because he had only received fifty thousand marks of that money. See how this most holy father of ours loved us ! After this, for the benefit of us all, and to pacify Italy, (especially as we were obliged to give up all hopes of any good-will being shown us by our fisither, or rather our stepfather,) we took up our arms and shield, and assembled our forces fi:om the provinces of Grermany, (to which at that time we had been called by necessity, owing to the foul play of our son,) for the purpose of invading Italy, strengthening our just cause with brave soldiers, as we could not obtain our ends by entreaties. When this came to the knowledge of the supreme pontiff he, on the plea of the truce agreed on by the faithful people and princes of the earth, for the sake of assisting the Holy Land, by apostolic letters, forbade our entering Italy with an armed force ; then, forgetting this, on the very day on which he proclaimed the aforesaid truce, he asked us, as a defender and advocate of the Church, to proceed in force against the Romans, who, he said, had taken away some of the church\'s possessions, although he considered it unjust in us that we

He also added, in the aforesaid letters, that in the matter of Lombardy, we ought, without any delay and unconditionally, without reserving any honour or claim to the empire, to make a compromise with him, by which he could either prevent us for ever from prosecuting any claim of ours, or coidd, at his pleasure, stifle the rights and honour of the empire. But, as neither the advice of our chiefs, nor the memory of past losses, recommended us to do this, he then had recourse to other devices, sending a rapacious wolf in sheep\'s clothing to meet us, namely, the bishop of Prseneste, commended to us by the apostolic letters 83 a man of most holy life, by whose means he recalled to the perjuries of the Milanese faction the city of Placentia, which was subject and friendly to us, firmly thinking, by his means, so generally to confuse our faithful subjects, and to such a degree, that he might entirely enervate our purpose of proceeding into Italy. In this hope, however, by the mercy of God, who protects his empire, he was entirely deceived ; and the tire spreading amongst our rebellious subjects, and the depopulation caused by the slaughter of the guilty, cried aloud upon him, reproaching him for having inspired them with confidence in their rebellion, and also for his breach of faith, because he had promised to assist them against us and the empire ; and because he could not, in accordance with their request, justly excommimicate us on the aforesaid opportunity, he clandestinely threw obstacles in the way of our proceedings in all directions, by sending letters and messengers throughout the empire, and all parts of the world, to seduce whomsoever he could from their faith and declaration of allegiance to us. But, as the good faith of our subjects and the affection of our friends would not allow all these circumstances to be kept from our knowledge, we, not choosing to be conquered by evil, but rather wishing to conquer evil by good, determined to send special messengers to the Apostolic See, and, accordingly, dispatched thither the venerable the archbishop of Palermo, the bishops

With this answer our messengers and his returned to us, but before they had been three days\* journey distant firom the court, without their knowledge, and to their concision, he gave the legatine office in Lornbardy to G. de Monte Longo, whom he had in the first place sent as a messenger to us, and had afterwards appointed to subdue Mantua, and to seduce other faithM subiects of ours, thinking the gr\^vter power that was given to him, the more he woidd be able to throw impediments in the way of us and our followers.

But not even by all this was his fury averted from us, but this so-called vicar of Christ, the preacher of peace, but who is in reality a stirrer up of schism and a friend of dissensions, in opposition to the injunctions of the holy fathers, when he heard that oiu\* messengers were bearing to him our offer of devotion in all matters, fearing that, if they reached him, he would be checked by the rampart of justice, and woidd, perhaps, be unable to proceed fiirther without exciting public scandal, in his too great haste he conceived an abortive design, and, contrary to the special custom of the holy mother Church, on Palm Simday hurled a sentence against us, the supreme prince of the Christians, and afterwards repeated the same on the day of our Lord\'s Supper, by which (as we have heard by report, although we ought to put little credence in it) he is said to have bound us with the chains of excoi\^munication, by the advice of certain Lombard cardinals, although the wiser portion of his brethren opposed it ; he also, by means of Ins abettors and satellites, who are supported out of the patrimony of poor people, prevented our messengers, who had now arrived, from going into his presence, and appearing before the public, to prove the justice of our cause and our innocence, and, indeed, to offer satisfe\<3tion, even to the giving of security. Concerning which, although, for singular and peculiar reasons, owing to the justice of our cause and the infamy of his proceeding, we ought justly to have preferred it, yet that he proceeded rashly and irregularly, since he would in any way give vent to his wickedness, woiild not, perhaps, have previously become known ; but we grieve in our heart, out of shame for the holy mother Church, which our Lord Jesus Christ, under the appearance of the Blessed Virgin, intrusted to his disciple in the Testament of his passion. Otherwise we do not think that any injury could have been done to us by this man, whom we with good reason do not consider as our judge, because he previously declared himself to be our chief enemy, as well as our judge, by word and deed, and openly favoured the VOL.

Moreover, he rendered himself imworthy of the submission of such a great prince, and, indeed, of any pontifical authority at all, inasmuch as, in opposition to us and the empire, he protected with his manifest favour the city of Milan, which is, according to the testimony of a great many credible religious men, inhabited for the most part by heretics. Also, when the bishop of Florence, a man of irreproachable life and good character, brought several articles of heresy against K. de Mandello, a citizen of Milan, and formerly podesta of Milan and Clar rentia, out of hatred to us and favour to the Milanese, he was not listened to. Moreover, we think him unworthy to be considered a vicar of Christ, a successor of Peter, and dispenser of the souls of Christians ; not on accoimt of the injury done to our dignity, but to the faults of the person, because the dispensations, which ought to be granted only after great deliberation with his brethren, he weighed in the scale of traffic, like a merchant, and granted in his own chamber, concealing the opinions of his brethren (with whom, according to ecclesiastical discipline, he was boimd to deliberate), thus making himself his own sealer, writer, and, perhaps, his own accoimtant. Concerning which matters, we do not wish to pass over in silence the remarkable dispensations by which, on receiving a small sum of money, he allowed Sipha, the daughter of the late constable of the kingd6m of Cyprus, to become the wife of Balian de Jocelin, contrary to the sentence of separation pronounced by the bishop of Nicosia in that matter, and the oath he had given at the same time that he would not have her ; and also allowed the sister of John of Csesareato marry James of Amendolia, who had previously married her sister, both of them being traitorous to us, and the women being both related to him in the third degree, and whatever was deficient in the amount of money paid to him, for this was made up by the degree of his hatred to us. We also grieve at his sin and prevarication in the fact, that, not content with spending money in order to gain over the nobles and chiefs of Romania, to become his followers and adherents, he wasted the possessions of the Eoman church, which is intrusted to our special protection, to bestow on them castles and possessions given to the holy fathers by the pious devotion of

Behold, we, by our letters and messengers, call on the cardinals of the holy Roman church, by the blood of Christ, and imder attestation of the Divine judgment, to summon a general council of the prelates and other faithful followers of Christ ; we also sent for our messengers and those of the rest of the princes, before whom we ourselves were present, and prepared to explain and prove all we have said ; and even worse matters than them. And we are not the less disturbed by the probable reason that this ruler of the Church, who ought to possess all kinds of virtues, to be of the greatest constancy, a chosen vessel, and without the stain of cupidity, lest the error of the chiefs should be propagated with increase amongst those subject to them, is endeavouring to trample on the rights of the empire, contrary to his promise, given by the advice of his brethren, and expressed in his letters, by which he promised not to £Edl us, but to aid us with his counsel, assistance, and favour, in restoring the strength of the said empire ; and is, moreover, heaping infamy, not to say blasphemy, on our person ; especially as, however careftilly we balance the scale of our conscience, we find in ourselves no occasion or reason why this inimical man ought to be so bitterly excited a\^iast us, unless that our majesty believed it improper, and considered it unworthy of us, to enter into a contract with him for the marriage of his niece with our natural son Henry, now king of Tunis and Gralluri.

Nor is it to be wondered at j for he was pricked by the urgent and sharp sophistries of the Lombards, to whom, as we have learnt by the confession of some prelates, he gave his oath in his own person, to act against us and the empire ; and when we were on a pilgrimage in Syria, in the service of Jesus Christ, he sent them into the kingdom ; but when the time for the fulfilment of the above promise came, he could lawfully break his word and alter the decree which had been issued.

This beast, endeavouring to grind everything to pieces with its claws and teeth of iron, and to trample with its feet on the universal world, formerly prepared secret battering-engines against the &ith ; and now it openly sets in array the engines of the Ismaelites\^ turning souls from the right path, and rises against Christ, the Kedeemer of the world (the records of whose Testament\^ as report declares, he endeavours to destroy by the pen of heretic wickedness). Cease, therefore, to wonder, all of you, to whose ears the slanders of blasphemy against us which have emanated from this beast have reached, if we, who are subject to God in all manner of servitude, are assailed by the arrows of backbiters, since the Lord himself is not free from these insults ; cease to wonder if he draws the sword of injury against us, because he now aims at blotting out the name of the Lord frt\>m the earth ; but, that you may be the better able to oppose his lies by open truth, and to confrite his deceits by the arguments of purity, carefrdly examine the head, the middle, and the lower parts of this beast Frederick, the so-called emperor ; and, as you find only abominations and wickedness in his words, arm your sincere hearts with the shield of truth. Consider how the said Frederick, by his letters, sent throughout the various coimtries of the world, has endeavoured to stain the sincerity of the Apostolic See and our own by his polluted statements ; a worker of fidsehoods ; ignorant of all modesty, and imtinged by the blush of shame, he falsely asserts that we, on being raised to the office of the apostleship, abandoned him, who was a friend to us of old, when we were in an inferior station, and that we broke our faith, and changed our conduct ; that when he was boimd by an oath, and the sentence of excommunication issued against him, to proceed to the assistance and defence of the Holy Land, at a time pre-arranged, and was unable to go, from sickness, we sought to strain the force of excommunication against him, and refused him the benefit of absolution on his recovering his health ; and that when he

And he boasts that, when he returned fipom Syria into Apulia, he refrained from avenging the injury done to him, accepted our offer of goodwill and peace, and returned to the mother Church ; but, although the general knowledge of facts disproves these falsehoods, yet sometimes a concealed lie takes possession of the seat of truth in the ear of sincerity, when truth finds in it no advocate for itself therein. And in order that fedsehood may not by any deceitful means creep into your hearts, it is proper that you should not be left in ignorance of the true particulars and manner of our proceeding. Both before and after we took on our shoulders the burden of the apostolic office, we distinguished with all favour this said Frederick, who is a wolf in sheep\'s clothing, until all the hope which is conceived by a father of his son was destroyed in us ; for the said Frederick, blustering in his greatness, and intoxicated with the power he had acquired, returned evil for good •to his mother the Church ; and began, like a scorpion, with the sting of its tail, to infuse poison into her, whilst at times he soothed her with the painted falsehoods of his words. For some time since, when the necessities of the Holy Land, the aforesaid sentence and his oath, and the period fixed upon for his departure demanded that he should set sail, and many thousand crusader\^ who were awaiting him at Brundusium, requested him with great earnestness to do so, he detained the said crusaders there till, owing to the unseasonableness of a climate to which they were unaccustomed, they perished by pitiable deaths from various diseases ; and thus, voluntarily incurring the charge of perjury and the jsentence of excommunication, this man, imsoimd in faith, but sound in body, neglected to make the passage he had promised, that he might more safely spread lies against God,

And when we were informed by letters fipom the prelates residing there, of his feigning sickness and the other foregoing matters, we feared lest ourselves and the Apostolic See Siould become notorious for failing to apply the rod of discipline to so weighty a crime : we deplored the death of the crusaders and the danger to the Holy Land, and wishing, at least in one case, to wipe away the tears of the Church\'s sorrow, with the right hand of due consolation, we determined that he was subject to the sentence of excommunication, passed on him with his own consent by the authority of our predecessor of blessed memory. Pope Honorius, earnestly entreating that we might hear he had amended his ways, and confessing his great misdeeds, would afford us the hopedfor aid, offering him, in our letters, that we would give him the benefit of absolution in due form, as soon as he would set out on the crusade aforesaid j but he, in whose breast there was little trouble about these matters, paying little heed to the keys of the Church, crossed into Syria without being absolved, where he entered into a treaty for six years with the soldan, on condition only that the walls of Jerusalem should be restored to him, and sending to him a large number of horses and armed men to assail the Christians, and leaving the Lord\'s temple to the company of the Saracens, who there sang the praises of Mahomet, he was changed from a defender to an enemy, and with all his might assailed our venerable brother the patriarch of Jerusalem and the Templars. It ought not, however, to be believed by any person of soimd mind, that we, or our legates, endeavoured to impede him in recovering the kingdom of Jerusalem, since the Church had greatly exerted itself to effect this purpose, and had borne much of the burden of the great expense. But it is well known to the whole world, that this said Frederick, in the same way as he in person was persecuting the Church of God in Syria, so, by the agency of the said Beynald, whom, con 

For the said Beynald invaded the territory of the Church, protected by letters sealed with the golden bull, and supported by the money, and attended by the vassals of the said Fredericl\^ presumed to suspend, mutilate, and slay some priests and clerks, and also, as we were in a disturbed state, to take possession of the province of Perusium, belonging to the said Church\'s territory. And although our faithful and devoted subjects, who could no longer endure such proceedings, expelled him from that part of the country, Christ giving the victory to his spouse ; yet because the said Reynald would by no means desist from his persecution, they considered that it would be more prudent to cut into the veins of the original evil than to await the violence of the already disturbed torrent, which would be swollen by fresh rivulets ; they therefore entered the kingdom of Sicfly, which is the spiritual patrimony of the Church, that they may not ask of us javelins from that quarter whence assistance ought to be expected ; and though many of the inhabitants of that kingdom became obedient to the Apostolic See, yet they ought not, on that account, to be considered in any way guilty of perjury, since they were released from the oath of fealty they had given to the said Frederick by the sentence of excommunication which had been pronounced against him. When the said Frederick returned from the transmarine provinces, and came to the bosom of the mother Church, we opened the bosom of the Apostolic affection, and, inclining a favourable ear to his request for peace, we granted to him the benefit of absolution. In addition to these things, this son of lies, heaping falsehoods on falsehoods, in order that the more he was entangled in the nets of fiilsehood, the greater might be the perils in which he was ensnared, now declares, in a lying writing, that, on purpose to ruin him we promised, if he would go to Lombardy peaceably, and without an army, we would smooth all difficulties, and that through the opposition made by our letters and messengers, we hindered him from attaining the goal of his intentions ; and that, because he was not supported by arms, being compelled to return into his kingdom, he falsely asserts that at our instance he defied the Eomans then attacking Viterbo, and sent a strong body of

Would that this false-speaJdng man were one possessed of spirit. Would that this statement of felsehood had had a true result. With regard to the matter of restoring to him and the said Conrad their rights in the city of Jerusalem, which they had been deprived of, and which matter had been arranged by our venerable brother the bishop of Ravenna, he, without regard to truth, complains that, as soon as the money could be brought and paid, we distributed it amongst the Christians (who were harassed by hostile attacks, attended by burnings of churches and slaughter of men), and that we interdicted aU aid from him, and on that account would not send a messenger or letters. Also he is not ashamed with his lying pen to write letters stating that, contrary to the terms of peace, and the advice of our brethren, the city of Castellana was detained by us to the prejudice of his rights. But although there is not the least atom of truth mixed up with these falsehoods, so as to give them a colouring, in order that you may more dearly understand that no slight mass of falsehoods discolours the whole of these statements, we wish you to know for certain that, although, as is now known by the course of events, it would appear probable, to a discreet mind, that he could better have gained his ends with the Lombards if he had shown himself an affectionate parent and a merciful lord to them, as they were strong in the number of their people, the thickness of their ramparts, their large army, and the height of their walls, than if he were to draw the sword of vengeance on his subjects, who were trembling for the offence imputed to them, and to strike terror into them by coming upon them with his legions of soldiers, we, who are boimd to pro 

And whilst the hands of the traitor were with us at the table, his deputy, on a given signal, as is openly proved against him by the consequences of his deed, and by his own letters, which are kept by us as a proof of his great treachery, made a covenant with the enemies of the Church, on the subject of that castle, which ought to be given up on a fixed day ; and so he gave them an excuse for remaining in arms. See what service this secret enemy affords to the Chiurch, who is not ashamed to transform himself into a servant of the same, in order that he may have more effectual means to injure us. We wish you, however, to be assured that we, passing over these matters connected with him in silence, did not allow the apostolic purity to undergo any change, but ordered the rights, of which he and the aforesaid Conrad had been deprived in the kingdom of Jerusalem, to be restored to them by the said archbishop, to whom the legatine duties were intrusted ; who, although he did so, yet exceeded the license given to hira, because an appeal had been made to us from him ; and, after an appeal against this sentence, laid the Holy Land imder an interdict, a proceeding unheard of at any time previous.

Let not, therefore, your mind be disturbed because, owing to this, he reproaches us with his polluted lips ; for, although the vessel is ftdl of the dross of vice, he thinks that the same stings of crime which have tainted his own mind, rage also in others ; wherefore, as the insults of wicked men resound prai&e, and their praise insult, we much prefer being attacked by the slanders of this man, whose every word teems with infamy,

But perhaps he thinks to wash away the stain of his opinions by these reproaches ; for whilst he was staying at Viterbo, corrupting that place, he shamelessly fled fipom before the enemies of the Church, and, lavish of the honour of the empire and held back by fear, he did not go to the defence of his faithful subjects, whom his enemies were besieging before his very eyes, and who found no one to prevent them from devastating the country, he declaring that his proceeding to their aid was forbidden by us j and from this he accused us in our innocence for not having sent a messenger a latere, to prevent the losses incurred by this war. Nor is it to be wondered at, since the Church was at that time harassed by the manifold vex\* ations of its persecutors. \"We came to the city of Castellana, the citizens of which, violating their oath of fealty, and without the knowledge of the Church, betrayed that (.\'hurch, and gave themselves up to him, but could not by this proceeding acquire any right in themselves, nor could they bring any injury on us as to the possession of the city, inasmuch as we possessed the jurisdiction, as it were, of the city and citizens. For if men possess for the benefit of another and not of themselves, it is vain to make demands upon them : the beginning of possession cannot destroy the laws of possession, or confer on strangers the rights of the true possessors. Also, as he had often given his oath to restore the possessions which belonged to him, by reason of the Church, he seemed to act imprudently in asking from us what he could not retain possession of without being guilty of perjury. But it must not be believed in this matter that we despised the coimsel of our brethren, as we were prepared to do every kind of justice to him, according to the decision of arbitrators, or in any other way ; but as his messengers reftised to proceed with the trial, which had been commenced, it was not required of us ; but his design rather was to have proceeded with that petition only for the deceitftil purpose of \^being thus afforded an opportunity of reviling the Church, and of destroying the peace which had been made between it and him.

This man, too, to whom was perhaps denied by divine judgment the power either to confess the truth or to }3ronoanoe justice, as he was not ashamed, on false grounds, to disparage our person, so also he did not fear to make his own excuses in similar assertions, and to declare that he, through his messengers, our venerable brother the archbishop of Palermo, and some others, who were sent to the Apostolic See, had offered to show his devotion in all matters connected with re-establishing the liberty of the Church, and restoring her rights and those of the empire ; and he also asserts that, when his messengers were returning to him, we, although we promised and endeavoured to desist from impeding him in any way, intrusted the duties of the legateship to our well-beloved son G, de Monte Longo, our notaiy, to the ruin of his subjects ; and he concludes by falsely stating, that although, notwithstanding this, he sent back the aforesaid archbishop and his other messengers to the Apostolic See, and, through them, offered every kind of satisfaction, we, contraiy to the injimctions handed down by the holy Others, and to the special custom of the Church, unjustly excommunicated him, although we were opposed by the wiser portion of our brethren ; adding, to his own shame, that we, the vicar of St. Peter, had not the power of binding and loosing, as though he would declare that we were without the power of the keys which was given to the chief of the apostles.

Moreover, considering that in thus acting she had done but little for him, she obtained for him the government of the kingdom of Jerusalem, and exalted him in all parts of the world ; and although, to her sorrow, she felt herself injured in manifold ways by him, yet for some short time past she powerfully assisted him against his son Henry, who had seduced a large portion of Grermany from its allegiance to him, and, forgetting the wounds inflicted on her by him, raised him, as it were, anew to the imperial dignity, and also, at his request, reformed Grermany by the apostolic letters. By these and other benefits, which we cannot recollect, she raised the defences of his honour ; but this staff of the impious, this hammer of the earth, desiring to disturb the whole earth, to crush kingdoms, and to make the world a desert, reduced the liberty of the Church in the said kingdom of Sicily to a disgraceful state of the lowest servitude, overwhelming with filth, burdens, and other oppressions, the churches, of which, to fill his own belly out of their tenderness, he had entirely torn the bones out, as it were ; he robbed them of their sacred property, that had been assigned to the uses of holy men, consigned ecclesiastics to prison, compelled them to undergo accusation, to pay talliages, and to exhaust the property of the churches, that they might redeem themselves from his oppressions, and finally (frove them into exile.

He impeded the recovery of the Holy Land and the crusade, by forbidding any of the property of his subjects to be given for the accomplishment of that object. Contrary to his pledged oath and the terms of the peace made between him and the Church, he deprived the nobles of their castles and other property, imprisoned their wives and children, compelled them to abandon their own places, and to transfer their abodes to the dwelling-places of others ; those brought up in crimson he obliged to lie in the mire, and reduced them to a state of the lowest destitution. Whilst also he oppressed the poor with similar injuries, we think that he displeased God the more, the more truly we believe that they were innocent. What further shall I say ? He, by unheard-of cruelties, reduced barons, knights, and other people of the said kii\^gdom of Sicily, to the condition of slaves ; and now the inhabitants of that kingdom, for the most part, have not the means of resting on a bed of their own, however vile, of covering their nakedness with coarse sackcloth, and can scarcely fill their bellies with dry bread. And as the lamentations and complaints of the said churches and of the people had continually worried the ears of the Church, since the time of our predecessor, the said Honorius, and as we could scarcely pass over them in silence without wounding our conscience, we, by messengers and letters, not only once, but several times, warned him to correct his faults ; and have waited with great patience for some time past to see if he would perchance raise his eyes towards heaven, shake oft\* the old and put on the new man, and restrain his hands fipom the perpetration of such gi\'eat crimes. Still, moreover, being doubtful about the required reformation, we wished to congratulate him on his own progress in the amendment of his condition ; and when he entered Lombardy in arms, we sent orders that in the places lying under interdict, for whatever cause it might be, the interdict should not be observed where he was present ; and by our letters we warned the said Frederick to give us a strict promise not to

Again, as it is incumbent on us, in our office of servant to the servants of Grod, to repair the chasms caused by schism, in order to set at rest the discord existing between the empire and the Lombards, we thought proper to send the bishop of Prseneste, charged with the legatine office, chiefly for this consideration, namely, that for themselves and all others quarrelling, he should with the less reason be held suspected, in proportion as by his actions he should cause less matter for hatred or fiivour, who being drawn away from the world and the flesh by the enterprise of holy religion, had mounted to the height of the divine love. Let our detracter answer for himself what imputation can be brought on these groimds against us and the same bishop, if at Placentia concord was effected between fathers, sons, connecting relations, and cousins, himself being present and protesting that this was accomplished without prejudice to the honours and rights of the emperor, the empire, and any others whom it might concern. Moreover, let this said blasphemer understand, that it is justly considered a disgrace to him, that although, at his request and that of his messengers, we had sent our venerable brother the bishop of Ostia, and our son T., a cardinal priest of St. Sabina, to those parts, for the purpose of re-establishing peace between the empire and the Lombards, according to the terms given by his said messengers ; and although the said legates were prepared to fulfil the terms demanded, and even to grant more, we found ourselves deceived, as he refused to agree to the re-establLshraent of peace on the terms offered by them. Now understand how we had trampled on the rights of the empire ; learn from the foregoing matters how he has been impeded by us ; for he determined that his own shoulders, and those of his followers, should be bruised by long and useless labour, rather than allow the rights of the empire to be re-established by us.

Wherefore, with this only reflection in his mind, that his heart was directed to the ruin of the churches and the Catholic £uth, he was, with good reason, suspected by us, from whom he could now no longer conceal himself under the garb of deceit, because we, becoming suspicious of his power, out of r\^ard to justice, and as it is better to preyent woimds than to find a remedy after their infliction, intrusted the legatine office to the said notary, for the purpose of stopping his progress ; which we did not do by any means out of suspicion of him, but that, by means of the said legate, we might be able to preyent the slaughter of war, and obyiate the perils impending oyer souls and bodies. Being unable, therefore, from the foregoing circumstances, and others besides, to entertain hopes of his amendment, and grieying that we haye been so often deluded by his promises so often made, we, by the adyice of our brethren, pronoimced sentence of excommunication on the aforesaid Frederick. Although, owing to this, he ought to haye resumeu his lost senses, and to haye humbled himself more before God, yet he only rayed the more furiously thereupon, as he now found out his own confusion, and strongly feared that the coils of the serpent would be unfolded by the mediating hand of the Church ; declaring that we were unworthy by

He also falsely asserts, that we are provoked against him, because he refused his consent to the contracting of a marriage between a niece of ours and his natural son ; he openly declares that we gave our personal oath to the Lombards to act against him and the empire, and that we promised to convert to his use the tithes of the whole world, which were reserved for the benefit of the Holy Land, if he would submit the Lombard afiair to our decision. We confess that we are wanting in merit to be the vicar of Christ ; we confess that we are inadequate to such a heavy burden, which no mortal of any condition can support without God\'s assistance ; nevertheless, we perform the duties of the office intrusted to us as well as our firailty allows us, and endeavour to dispose matters as the quality and natul\^ of places, times, per\^ns, and cinnmistanL require, and, when necessity demands it, grant dispensations to the fall extent of our power, freely, and in accordance with our duty to God, to those deserving it. Nevertheless, it is not a cause of sorrow that he woimds the Church so deeply, as also that, whilst he passes the limits of the kingly office, he is unable to assail the duties of the priests. Owing to which circumstance, this man, who out of thirst for gold has reduced the said kingdom of Sicily to ashes, who has all his life afforded pure justice to but few, whilst he has corruptly sold it to many, that, reviving the great Simon in his own person, he may be able to pollute the Church with the filth of temporal gain, that he may thus be allowed to assail spiritual matters and to remain in his own filth, has attempted, in many ways, to break through the wall of the Church\'s purity, and especially by the offer of castles, and the entertainment of kindred feelings between his people and ours, which he has often requested of us through certain great prelates, and his messengers as well. But as he could not obtain this from us by any entreaties, by any device (as q2

There is one thing at which, although we ought to mourn for a lost man, you ought to rejoice greatly, and for which you ought to return thanks to God, namely, that this man, who delights in being called a forerunner of Antichrist, by God\'s will, no longer endures to be veiled in darkness ; not expecting that his trial and disgrace are near, he with his own hands undermines the wall of his abominations, and, by the said letters of his, brings his works of darkness to the light, boldly setting forth in them, that he could not be excommunicated by us, although the vicar of Christ ; thus affirming that the Church had not the power of binding and loosing, which was given by our Lord to St. Peter and his successors; and thus asserting heresy, he concludes by an argument suited to him, proving by this that he thinks badly of the other articles of the orthodox faith, inasmuch as he endeavours to deprive the Church, on which that faith is founded and supported, of the privilege of power granted to it by the word of God. But as it may not be easily believed by some people that he has ensnared himself by the words of his own mouth, proofs ai\^ ready, to the triumph of the Mth ; for this king of pestilence openly asserts, that the whole world was deceived by three, namely, Christ Jesus, i Moses, and Mahomet ; that, two of them having died in glory, the said Jesus was suspended on the cross ; and he, moreover, presumes plainly to affirm (or rather to lie), that all are foolish who believe that God, who created nature, and could do all things, was bom of the virgin. This heresy he confirms by the false doctrine that no one can be born whose conception has not been preceded by connection between man and woman, and no man ought to believe anything beyond what can be proved by the force and reason of nature. These and many other words, as well as deeds, by which he has attacked, and still attacks, the Catholic faith, can be plainly proved in their proper time and place, as is proper and expedient.

This letter, having been published and sent to a great many kings, princes, and nobles throughout the world, with only the titles changed, struck fear and dread as well as astonishment to the hearts of those of the true faith, and rendered the emperor\'s letter suspected, although it contained probable facts, and also re-established the minds of many which had formerly been in a wavering state. And, had it not been that the (feoman ava\^S\^iad alienated the devotion of people from the pope more than was expedient and proper, the whole world would have been exasperated by this letter, and would have risen unanimously against the emperor as an open enemy of Christ and the Church. But, alas ! many sons had become estranged from their father, and, adhering to the cause of the emperor, they asserted that inextinguishable hatred, now become hardened between them, excited the aforesaid strife and invectives. The pope unjustly stated that he loved the said Frederick, and advanced his interests at the beginning of his promotion ; for all this was done out of hatred to Otho, whom the Church, with Frederick\'s assistance, persecuted to death, because, according to his oath, he endeavoured by force to assemble together the scattered portions of the empire, as the present emperor Frederick also is endeavouring to do ; wherefore, by doing

In the summer of this year, a little before the commencement of autumn, the emperor, wishing to prevent the Bolognese from rendering assistance to his traitorous subjects the Milanese, made a formidable attack on them ; for they were endeavouring, in fevour of the pope and their neighbours the Milanese, to sally forth and make an attack on the emperor s army ; but as they were sallying forth, the emperor suddenly came upon them, and placing his troops between the citizens and the city, he scattered their battalions in dreadful disorder ; and the fugitives endeavouring to retreat to the city by by-ways, precipitated themselves into the river, which it was necessary for them to cross to reach it ; so that more perished by the miserable death of drowning than by the sword. The emperor next, after the Bolognese who remained in the city had given him their right hands in token of friendship, led his army against Milan, and having erected his engines, and constructed bridges, he, in a short space of time, with his numerous army, crossed the trenches, with which the Milanese had surroimded themselves on all sides. Fear and trembling then took possession of the citizens, and by the news of the misfortune of the Bolognese woe was heaped on woe ; and this business would soon have been brought to a conclusion, had not a dangerous disturbance, excited by the pope, summoned the emperor to distant parts ; on learning which circumstance, the citizens becoming more bold, again raised their head, and traversing the neighbouring provinces, laid siege to the emperor\'s castles. Being also strengthened and encouraged by a legate, whom the pope had sent thither for their comfort and consolation, they surrounded and laid siege to Ferrara ; and by advice of the legate, who, without pity, forced them to do so, they refused all terms of reparation from the besieged, unless they surrendered unconditionally. At this time, too, one of the companions of St. Oswin was found. The king forces a Briton as prior upon the convent of Winchester. At this time the king practised great oppression on the church of Winchester, and, agaiost the wL«di of the whole

The same spunous prior, in spite of the fi;ee right ot election vested in the monks, drew almost half the stars in his train, and corrupting the hearts of many, inclined them to the election of William, uncle of the queen. For the king was fully bent upon bringing this to pass. The death of William, bishop elect qf Liege, As the feast of All Saints drew near, William, bishop elect of Valentia,of whom we have made mention above as having obtained permission from the pope to be elected bishop of Liege, and to hold the bishopric of Winchester, closed his life at Viterbo, having, as was said, been poisoned at the instigation of Master Lawrence, an Englishman, but who afterwards entirely cleared himself of the charge. When the pope heard of this event, he was much grieved, for he had purposed to make him the commander of his army in his war against the emperor, and had thus made him a spiritual monster and a beast with many heads ; for he knew that he was strenuous in slaughter, prone to bloodshed, and wanton in incendiarism ; that he was master of the English king, a friend of the French monarch, a brother-in-law of both of them, an uncle of their queens, a brother of the count of Savoy, and allied to many others by kindred or blood ; his unexpected death, however, disconcerted his whole scheme. The king\* 8 grief for the death of the q/bresaid William. The king, when he heard this mournful news, could not restrain himself for grief, but tore his clothes, and threw them into the fire, and, giving vent to loud lamentations, refused to accept consolation from any one ; the queen, too, who was excited by a more familiar cause of sorrow, mourned his death for a long time. About this time, too, died Evelyn, countess of Albemarle, a woman of remarkable beauty. Also, on the 21st of December, died Henry de Trubleville, a most brave knight, and one of great experience in warlike expeditions. VOL. I. B

About this time, the pope wrote to the French king, and sent special messengers to him, with a message to order this letter to be solemnly and thoughtfully read in the presence of him and the whole of the barons of France ; the main purport of which letter was said to have been as follows : --- \" Be it known to the beloved son of the spiritual Church --- \^the illustrious king of France, as well as to the whole community of barons of that kingdom, that we, after a careful discussion and deliberation with our brethren, have condemned and cut off the so-called emperor Frederick from the imperial dignity, and have elected Count Robert, brother of the French king, in his stead, whom not only the Church of Rome, but the Church universal, has thought fit with its utmost endeavours to assist and promote to that dignity. Be not, therefore, on any accoimt slow to receive with open arms such a great dignity, which is voluntarily offered, and to obtain which we will freely afford assistance, both in labour and money. For the manifold crimes of the aforesaid Frederick, of which the world is well aware, have irrevocably condemned him.\" To this offer the great caution of the French king suggested the following reply : --- \" In what spirit, or by what rash presumption has the pope disinherited and hurled from the imperial dignity such a great prince, than whom there is none greater ; yea, whose equal is not to be found amongst Christians, when he has not been convicted oi, nor confessed, the charges brought against him \] who, even if he merited to be deposed, owing to his urgent sins, could not be deprived of his crown, unless by a decision of a general council. With regard to his transgressions, we ought not to put faith in his enemies, of whom the pope is well known to be the chief ; to us he is, as yet, innocent, yea, and a good neighbour ; nor have we seen anything sinister in his secular fealty or his Catholic fidth ; but we know that he has &ithfully fought for our Lord Jesus, and exposed himself to the dangers of the sea and of war on hid behalf : such religion we have not discovered in the pope. Yea, the very person who ought to have promoted his wel£are, and protected him when fighting for Cod, endeavoured to destroy and sapplant

We do not wish to throw ourselves into such great dangers as to attack such a powerful prince as this said Frederick, whom so many kingdoms would assist against us, and who would give their support in a just cause. What would the lavish efiusion of our blood matter to the Romans, so long as we sativsfied their anger 1 If the pope should conquer him by our means, or the help of others, he would trample on all the princes of the world, assuming the horns of boasting and pride, since he had conquered the great emperor Frederick. But in order that we may not appear to have received the pope\'s mandate as an empty message, although this appears to have emanated from the church of Rome more out of hatred to the emperor than from love for us, we will send prudent messengers from us to the emperor, to make a careful inquiry as to his opinions of the C\'atholic faith, and to inform us of them : and if they discover nothing but what is right, why is he to be molested ? But, if otherwise, we will persecute him, even to the death, aye, or even the pope himself, or any mortal who thinks evilly of God.\" On hearing which reply, the pope\'s messengers went away in confusion. Special French messengers were then sent to the emperor to tell him the particulars of the message they had received from the pope. The emperor, when he heard them, was perfectly astonished at the enormity of the pope\'s hatred, and replied that he was a Catholic and a Christian, and entertained right opinions on all the articles of the orthodox faith, and, added he : \" May it please God that I shall never abandon the steps of my noble forefathers and predecessors, and follow the footsteps of tEoie\~dboined\^\"\^o pemitionT Let God judge between me and him, who has so basely slandered me throughout the world.\" Then raising his hands to heaven, and with sighs and gushing tears, he exclaimed : \" May the Lord God of vengeance award him just retribution.\" Then turning to the messengers he said : \" My friends, and well- beloved neighbours, whatever this enemy of mine --- this thirster after my blood, and subverter of my honour --- may say, I believe the same a« any other Christian ; and if you determme to make war on me, do not be astonished if I defend myself against those who attack me ; for I trust that God, the protector of the innocent, will, in his might, free me from my enemies ; for he knows that the pope, in b2

But to you I owe a debt of gratitude, because you determined, before acceding to his request, to assure yourselves of the facts of the present case by my answer.\" To this the messengers replied, \" God grant that it may never enter our hearts to attack any Christian without manifest cause : and ambition does not excite us, for we believe that oiu\* lord the king of France, whom a line of royal blood has advanced to sway the sceptre of the French, is higher than any emperor whom only voluntary election advances to that dignity; and it is sufficient for Count Robert to be the brother of such a great king.\*\' And with these words the messengers went away, with the good-will and thanks of the emperor : and thus the pope\'s endeavours to effect his purpose entirely failed. The pope uses all his endeavours to collect money for his defence. The pope, in the mean time, by persuasions and exciting the people by manifold arguments, by the agency of the Preachers and Minorites, ettdeavoured to acquire money for himself; wherever it could be scraped together, to the injury of the emperor. The Preachers and IVGnorites had at this time become the special counsellors and messengers of kings ; so that, as those who were clothed in soft garments were\^ formerly in the houses of kings, so those, who were then clad in vile clothing, were in the houses, rooms, and palaces of princes. The king, at this time, simimoned his brother, John de St. Giles, to his council ; and many were astonished that the pope did not attend to the prayers of the Christians, as we read of St. Peter when kept in prison. The emperor dissuades the Crusaders from setting sail. The emperor now, by letter, advised the whole Jbody of crusaders --- although they were prepared, and it appeared a severe annoyance to them --- to wait with patience, and not take their departure for Jerusalem, until the blast of the pope\'s wrath was lulled, when he would joyfully accompany them ; because a countless host of eastern nations were prepared in arms to engage them. The rest, however, refused to listen to his advice ; on which, the emperor, in anger, forbade any vendible articles of food from being supplied or

The Saracens, when they heard of this, raised their heads; and becoming bold, caused much damage to the Christians, both in their persons and possessions, audaciously spreading fire and slaughter amongst them ; and, to add to the mass of their sorrows, Greece had set up her anti-pope against the Homan church : the emperor, too, had placed in o}jposition to the pope, Brother Elias, who had been for some time chief minister, and a most famous pi-eacher of the Minorite order ; and thus evils began to multiply on \^ the face of the earth, for he absolved all whom the pope anathematized, and great scandal was excited in the Church ; for by the machinations of this agent, the church of Rome was made notorious by charges of usury, simony, and robbery, and the sons were turned against the stepsons. The aforesaid Brother Elias asserted that the pope was venting his fury\^ainst the rights of the empire ; that he only thirsted for money, and extorted it by divers argimients ; and that he did not attend to prayers, masses, processions, and festings, by which the oppressed are usually freed from their persecutions, as it is written, \" Peter, therefore, was kept in prison ; but prayer was made without ceasing of the C hurch unto God for him f that he also practised fraud with the money collected for the assistance of the Holy Land ; that he privately sealed writings in his chamber, at his own pleasure, without obtaining the consent of the brethren ; and even gave his messengers a great many empty schedules, but sealed with his bidl, for them to write in them whatever suited their pleasure, which was dreadftd ; and many other charges he made against the •pope, uplifting his voice to heaven : wherefore, the pope excdmmunicated the said Elias. Simon the Norman\^ and brother Geoffrey are dismissed from the king\^s council. In the same year, while the Easter festivities were being kept up amidst much rejoicing, the harp of Master Simon the Norman was turned to grief, and his festivity into lamentation ; for this\' man, who had been for a long time before the master, not only of the kingdom and the royal seal, but also the ruler of the king himself, and the disposer of the afl\'airs of his court, at \^whose will all matters were

Incited by a like spirit, the king ordered brother Geoffrey, the Templar, to be dismissed from his court --- an event which many longed for. The origin and chief cauAe of this anger of the king\'s was, that the said Hinion refused to countersign an abominable warrant, contrary to the dignity of the king\'s crown ; the purport of which warrant was, that Count Thomas of Flanders should Tccjiive custom duty of fourpence for each sack of wool cartii\'d from England through his provinces; neither would Oeoffrey the Templar agree to it, although the king eagerly desired it. The monk» of Winchester obtain a free election from the pope. About this same time, the monks of Winchester, on rotuniing from the Koman court, obtained from the pope an order not to elect as the guardian of their souls any foreigner, or axiy one who was odious to the community of the kingdom, at the bitter instance or imperious entreaties of the king, but regularly, according to what was just and canonical, to make a free election, without exaction, of whomsoever they thought fit to be their bishop and pastor. At tl»i«, the king\'s anger was again kindled in a great degree, aH if ho could not find any born Englishman fit for that l)iHhoj)ric ; and from that time the prior also, whom the king had forced on them, applied himself with all diligence to weaken the firmness of the monks, and to dissolve the \])(\^aooful union of those who had heretofore manfully stood up on behalf of the Church.

At his approach, the inhabitant? .of Viterbo, with the nobles and citizens of other distinguished cities, and a large number of Romans, came to meet him, with all respect and honour, as their lord ; and this fact can plainly be proved by a letter which the emperor sent to the king of England.

But we are no less oppressed by this sorrow, namely, that the eyes of Eli the priest are become\^ dim, and do not perceive any of these dangers ; and that he is stimulated by such anger towards us, and is bound by such feelings of affection towards the Milanese and their abettors, who are rebelling against the empire, that, though the whole world is entirely exposed to the occurrences of a dubious succession of events, or rather to the perils of fortune, he rfees to trample on the justice of the holy empire, and to render assistance to our rebellious subjects the Milanese. But we are not pierced by the sting of a guilty conscience in this matter, nor do we expect the damaging judgment of fame ; for from times long past, by the Divine inspiration of a presage of aU these dangers, we have always avoided the present cause of scandal, and have endeavoured, by all the contrivances in our power, but in vain, to obtain favour with this supreme pontiff, not sparing our own personal toil, paying no regard to the loss of our property, and very often freely exposing the lives of our Mthfiil subjects for the assistance of him and the Boman

But (and we relate it with sorrow) during the whole time of our struggles, we have not received anything at all from him, no marks of affection have we had paid to us for our obedience, but he has always opposed himself to, and obstructed the advantage of, the holy empire ; yes, and what must be considered more cruel by every one, whilst we were employed in the service of the holy Church, he took the city of Castellana away from the empire, as is clearly proved by his letters, which the Castellans have lately forwarded to us, and at t\^t time we could not, notwithstanding aU our petitions, obtain anything &vourable to us or the empire ; and by secret contrawiictory letters, he subsequently deprived the legate of all authority, whom he said that he had sent into Syria to obtain satis&ction for the injuries inflicted on us and our son, by the inhabitants of Acre and some of the nobles of the kingdom of Jerusalem. Nor could we, at that very same time, obtain any letters to prohibit -the Milanese frt\>m attacking the inhabitants of Cremona\^ who were fidthfrd to the empire, nor the Florentines fix)m injuring our faithful subjects the Venetians, although he refused to grant us permission to proceed to their assistance, which we wished to do, in order that we might not leave the Church imdefended. Again, when we were proceeding to Germany, to check the malice of our eldest son, he verbally promised to &vour us in every respect ; but by a messenger of his, bearing credential letters, he secretly, by every attestation in his power, enjoined on our clue& who were present with us at the court at Mayence, not by any means to consent to the election of our younger son, or of any one of our house and blood. He afterwards, to the utmost of his skill and power, obstructed our progress into Italy to reform the state of the empire, both by his letters and messengers, and especially by the bishop of Praeneste, who, by every possible craft and cunning, gained over Piacenza and Mantua. At length, when by Grod\'s grace we had gained a victory by the slaughter of the Milanese, as he saw that these clandestine letters and legations were of no advantage to him, as tjie sword of our justice prevailed over his deceitfrd wickedness, he began more openly to throw obstacles in the way of our proceedings, and plainly forbade the citizens and nobles of the march of Ancona and the valley of Spoleto, whose duty it was to assist and

He also, notwithstanding our command and prohibition, enjoined on the inhabitants of Ancona and other maritime towns, under penalty of excommunication and a fine of ten thousand marks, to supply all necessaries to the Venetians who were in rebellion against our majesty, and all this is plainly proved by his letters. To some of the nobles of the march of Treviso, whom he had rendered weak and wavering in their allegiance to us, he sent letters, ordering them openly to secede from their allegiance, giving them to understand that, unless we chose absolutely to intrust the affairs of Lombardy to his disposal and authority, he would thunder forth the sentence of excommunication against us. After having taken counsel on all these matters with our well-beloved chiefs and others who were then assisting us at the siege of Brescia, we, wishing (as we before stated) to prevent any cause of offence from arising between us and the Church, sent special ambassadors from us to the Apostolic See, through whom we offered to render satisfaction also for some frivolous offences which he said had been attempted in our kingdom of Sicily, contrary to the rights and liberty of the Church, and by the same messengers agaia requested that the desired union between us and the Church, which we had often attempted to bring about by innumerable messengers, should be confirmed by messengers and by mutual securities. This he said he would willingly agree to, and committed the manner and form of security to our judgment j but when our messengers and his, in ftJl confidence that union and peace were established, were returning with alacrity to us, and were entirely out of his sight, he intrusted the office of the legateship in Lombardy to Gregory de Monte Longo, who was formerly suspected by us and ours, when we had received him as a simple nuncio in that province, and he, the pope, had promised to recall him from thence. To add to the mass of his wickedness, when he discovered us to be off our guard, owing to our confidence in the promised union, he ordered us to be admonished, by some chiefs and subjects of ours, of some offences which he said had been committed by our officials and messengers in the kingdom of Sicily and the city of Rome against him and the Church.

But we, who considered such a proceeding to be ftdl of temerity, and void of justice, sent letters to his brethren and the legates, demanding a general council to be convoked, at which we engaged to prove, by arguments clear as light, the baseness of the corrupt judge, and our own innocence ; on which, not to say spuming the proofe of our innocence, but even against the law of nations, which does not permit ambassadors or messengers to be insulted, this man, who styles himself \* servant of the servants of God,\' ordered the aforesaid messengers, our bishops, to be most disgracefully thrust into prison.

But for all these injuries, although he was proceeding rashly against us, in the spirit of his own anger, we were not provoked to visit him with the imperial vengeance, until he showed that he was dashing forward to effect our utter destruction, and to deprive us of our imperial inheritance, inasmuch as when we were stajdng in the march of Treviso, for the purpose of pacifying that district (which, owing to the old and continual dissensions, we found everywhere stained with the blood of the slain), he, by the present of a large sum of money, incited the marquis d\'Este, and the count of St. Bonifacio (who had, at the suggestion of the supreme pontiff, conspired against our life), as well as the city of Treviso, to rebel against us and the empire.

Not content with all this, he openly declared himself the leader and chief of the war against us and the empire, making the cause of the Milanese and other faithless traitors his own, and openly turning their business to suit his own interests ; moreover, he appointed as liis lieutenants over the Milanese, or rather the papal army, the before-mentioned Gregory de Monte Longo, and brother Leo, a minister of the Minorite order, who not only girded on the sword, and clad themselves in armour, presenting the false appearance of soldiers, but also continuing their office of preaching, absolved from their sins the Milanese and others, when they insulted our person, or those of our followers. At this time, too, the legate and Minorite brother aforesaid, sign themselves governors and lords, in opposition to us and the empire ; by which it is evidently given us to understand that the pope is not only a friend to the infidels, whom the public voice of the world declares to be heretics, but to the prejudice of the empire, and to disinherit us, he has usurped the temporal government and dominion of Milan. We, therefore, having been provoked beyond bounds by so many losses, and worried by so many injuries, could not restrain our hands, but took up the sword and shield publicly, to sustain our own cause and that of the empire against our public enemy, opposing temporal power by temporal power ; nor could we any longer show filial affection to him, for he not only would not return it by paternal affection, but endeavoured to injure and disinherit us, and cruelly thirsted after our life and blood.

About this time, on the 9th of August, which was St. Romanus\'s day, a conventual church was dedicated at Abingdon, by Robert, bishop of Salisbury, the diocesan of that place, and about the same time, too, a church was dedicated at Wells. In the same year the churches of Evesham, Gloucester, Tewkesbury, Wicumbery, Pershore, and Aldchester, were dedicated, as also many others throughout England. About Michaelmas of this year, Robert de Thony, a man of noble family, died at sea. About this same time, when the bishop of Lincoln was persecuting his canons, one of them in preaching a sermon to the people, complaining of the bishop, said, \" Even though we should hold our peace the stones will cry out for us,\" when on a sudden the stonework of the tower of the new church of Lincoln fell down, cnishing the people who were under it ; by the fell of which the whole church was shaken and injured, and this was taken as a sad omen ; the bishop, however, set to work to rebuild it effectually. T%e slaughter of ike Tartars, About this time the Tartars, a barbarous race of people, who had invaded the Christian countries and committed great slaughter, wandering here and there in Greater Hungary, were defeated and forced to retreat ; the greatest portion of these, however, were slain at the sword\'s point, and fell before the hand of power, having been attacked by five Christian and Saracen kings, who were united for this purpose by the grace of God\'s holy spirit. After the slaughter of these barbarians, the kings of Dacia and Hungary sent some Christians to inhabit the provinces, which had been reduced, as it were, to a desert by the said Tartars ; and more than forty ships went from Dacia alone filled with them.

One day, after having drawn up his legions and made some fatal attacks on the citizens, the chief of the city went out to him, as if with peaceable intentions, promising to surrender the city to the king, on condition that the lives of the inhabitants should be spared ; but this was all done in treachery, for he urgently begged of the king to enter the city as lus own, and receive homage from those whom his royal highness chose to spare the lives of; and the king, putting faith in his words and sighs, entered the city. As soon, however, as he had got inside, the citizens closed the gates, withdrew the bridges, and with drawn swords surrounded the king, who was attended by only a few followers, and fearing nothing of this kind ; but on suddenly looking round they saw themselves surrounded by the enemy, and knowing that it was a matter of life and death, they inflicted as much slaughter as they were able in return upon their proud enemies. After some time, however, as their enemies increased in numbers, they were unable any longer to endure the weight of the conflict, but thinking on the prophetic words of the prayer, \" O Lord, save the king,\" they got their lord away, by some postern gate. He, with much difficulty, escaped and returned to his army, which he found in a great measure cut to pieces by the enemy, who had attacked it, as had been pre-agreed on by these traitors : at sight of their king, however, sound in body, they regained their courage, and defeated their enemies ; the besieged, stained with the blood of their enemies, were slain or made prisoners, and the king, with what was left to him of his army, returned ingloriously to his own country, at the same time more cautious and still more resolute for the contest. 7%« king confers the knighfa belt on Baldwin de RiverSt and invests him with the earldom of the Isle of Wight.

The election of Hugh de Paieshull as bishop of Coventry. At this time the election of Hugh de Pateshull, bishop elect of Coveutry, was confirmed : he had for some years previously been treasurer to the king, and had conducted himself irreproachably in that office ; on his taking his seat in the royal treasury, he weut to all the barons of that office in his usual way, and on their all rising to pay him the accustomed marks of honour, he said to them, \" Dear friends and companions, I bid you farewell ; but I never leave you, only the treasury ; the Lord has summoned me, unworthy as I am, to imdertake the government of souls.\" His words then breaking off into sighs, he kissed them all one by one, they at the same time weeping most tenderly for his departure. The death of Isabella, wife of Earl Richard. About the same time the noble lady Isabella, countess of Gloucester and Cornwall, was taken dangerously ill of the yellow jaimdice, and brought to the point of deatl\]\^ and when her time for lying-in arrived (for she was pregnant and very near child-birth) she became senseless, and after having had the ample tresses of her flaxen hair cut off, and made a full confession of her sins, she departed to the Lord, together with a boy, to which she had given birth, and which, not being likely to live, had been baptized and received the name of Nicholas. When Earl Richard, who had gone to Cornwall at that time, heard of this event, he broke out into the most sorrowful lamentations, and mourned inconsolably ; he, however, returned with all haste, and caused the respected body of his wife to be buried with honour at BeauHeu, a house which King John had founded and built, and appropriated to the Cistercian order.

The emperor reproaches the king for allowing money to he carried away from his territories to the injury of them both. Before the business of the aforesaid council was completed, two messengers came from the emperor to the king, through whom the emperor sent word to the king by letter, that he was very much astonished that he allowed him, the emperor, to be so shamefully, unreasonably, excommimicated in a most Christian country, without any opposition on his part ; and that, unmindful of the marriage treaty and of the alliance entered into at the marriage of Isabella, now the empress, he allowed the condition and good name of him, the supreme grince, to be aspersed. Wherefore he demanded that the \^aider of this business, namely the legate, whom the king had unadvisedly summoned into his kingdom, should be expelled from the English territories ; because he declared that he was an enemy to him, as also to the kingdom of England, for he had impudently scraped together all the money he could, and from whencesoever he could, inorder to satisfy the pope\'s avarice and to disturb the imperial dignity. To these messages the king repHed, that it was his duty to obey the commands of the pope and the Chvqroh more readily than the other princes of the world, as i\^ could be proved that he was a tributary or vassal of the pop€i \\tj right ; and thus, by barely excusing himself, he brought 2\^ accusation against himself ; however, hoping to please the Jpmperor by this, he wrote to the pope, earnestly begging him, for the sake of the emperor\'s affinity to him, the king, to deal more mildly with him.

The king, on reflection, was afraid of something untoward happening to him, because he had made such a familiar friend of a secret enemy to the kingdom, like the legate ; he therefore advised him in good faith not to provoke the anger of his imperial majesty by staying any longer in England, but to cross the Alps as soon as possible, and consult with the pope. To this the legate replied : \" You have called me from my court, and I demand of you a safe-conduct, that I may return in safety.\" The emperor\'s messengers, of whom we have before made mention, on learning all these things, returned to their lord, to tell him, like sagacious spiesi, all they had seen and heard.

At his death, David, his son, to whom his father had assigned possession of Wales for his inheritance, with the consent of his eldest brother Griffin, with treacherous intentions, summoned his brother, the said Griffin, to a council. The latter, accordingly, came peaceably, under the conduct of R, bishop of Bangor, and some other nobles ; but David, regardless of their brotherly relationship and of good faith, ordered him to be seized, and, in spite of the protest of his conductors, consigned him to prison.

For it seemed absurd, even to simpleminded men, the divers traps by which the Roman court endeavoured to deprive the simple people of Grod of their substance, seeking for nothing but; gold and silver. The pope extorts the fifth part of their property from the beneficed foreigners in England, The pope now proposed and determined to extort the fifth part oP property and revenues of the foreign beneficed clerks in England, in order to annoy the emperor, who was encompassed by dangers on all sides from his enemies, whom the pope supported by the mcmey which had been collected by extortion in England ; he also continued to absolve from their fealty all who were bound by allegiaiicfe to the said emperor, and thus this dreadful enmity was confirmed, and day by day increased. The faithful counsellors of the king, too, said to him, \" Most illustrious lord and chief, why do you suffer England to become a spoil and a desolation to those who come over here, like a vineyard without a wall, common to every passenger, to be rooted out by wild boars, since you have an effectual privilege to prevent such exactions being made in this kingdom ; but he is unworthy of that privilege who abuses it when it is granted to him.\" To those who advised him thus, the king replied, \" I neither wish nor dare to oppose the pope in anything ; \" and a most lamentable despair took possession of the people.

In this year all the archbishops, bishops, chief abbats, and some of the nobles of the kingdom, assembled at Reading, to hear a message from the pope, published by the legate ; and when they had all assembled there, the legate, after making a lengthy sermon to incline the hearts of his hearers to him, finally made known to them all the various difficulties which the pope had undergone to obtain justice for the Church, by withstanding the assaults of the said emperor Frederick ; he, therefore, on behalf of the pope himself urgently demanded the fifth part of all their goods, by means of which he might be able to repel the injuries of such a powerful enemy. To this the bishops, after holding a council, replied, that they would never endure such an insupportable burden, which concerned the whole Church too, without careful and l)rolonged deliberation. A day was therefore appointed at some more remote period for them to deliberate on this important message. Earl Richard takes leave of the bishops assembled at Reading, Earl Bichard, and the other crusading knights who were present at this place, bade farewell to all there assembled ; for they were ready to start on their journey to Jerusalem. The prelates, when they saw this, all burst into tears, and said to Earl Eichard, \" Why, earl, our only hope, do you abandon us 1 or for whom do you desert us 1 we shall be desolate without yon. In your absence, rapacious foreigners \\vill invade us ! \" The earl then, in tears, replied to one of them, the archbishop of Canterbury, for all : \" My father and lord, of a truth, even had I not assumed the cross, I would still go, and absent myself, so that I might not see the evils of our people and the desolation of the kingdom, which it is believed I am able to prevent, although 1 cannot really do so.\" The dedication of the new temple.

In this year, Maurice Fitzgerald, justiciary of Ireland, sent four knights to the king\'s court, and demanded information in the above-mentioned case. \" U, by the grace of God, d&c, to the Justida/ry of Irdomd, greeting, --- Some knights, from the provinces of Ireland, have lately come to us, and explained to us, that our justiciaries who are going the circuit in those parts, are uncertain whether, in a case where an inheritance devolves to sisters in our kingdom of Ireland, the younger sisters ought to hold possession of it from the eldest sister, and do homage for their portions, or from their chief lord, and do homage to him. And, whereas the aforesaid knights have asked what has been the usual custom in our kingdom of England in simiLar cases, we, at their request, have to inform you, that in our kingdom of England, the law is as follows: That if any one holds from us in chief, and has daughters as heirs\^ at the death of the father, our predecessors and we ourselves have always received the homage of all the daughters, and each and all of them in this case hold from us in chiei\^ and, if they be under age, we have the charge of them and the marrying of them ; but if they hold of any other person than us, and the sisters be under age, their lord will have the custody and the marrying of each of them, and the eldest sister only will do homage to their lord for all of them, and the others, when they come of age, shall do their services to the lords of the fee by the hand of their eldest sister; and the eldest daughter shall not on that account

And, besides this, as the eldest sister is the heiress of all the other sisters, if they should die without heirs of their own, if she could have the guardianship of her sisters, or of their children, it would be like giving a lamb to be devoured by a wolf. And, therefore, we command you in this case, to cause the aforesaid custom as we observe it in our kingdom of England, to be claimed and strictly observed, as above stated, in our kingdom of Ireland.

At this time, Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, hoping and confidently expecting to have the same or similar assistance which the blessed martyr Thomas, the predecessor of the said archbishop, had found in Pope Alexander, of pious memory, began by soiTowfiil letters and special messengers to make pitiable complaints, by which he trusted to turn the stony heart of the pope to one of flesh ; entreating of him to abolish that detestable and destructive custom of the Church, by which kings, yea, tyrants and thorough enemies of, and rebels against, the Church, did not permit cathedral and conventual churches which were deprived of their pastor to take breath, nor to provide themselves freely and canonically with suitable pastors ; and that the king would not, following the movements of his own will rather than reason, impede their election by the agency of his cunning agents, -\^om he kept in pay for that purpose ; and that if any such church amon\^ them should be deprived of its pastor, and be vacant for six months, a competent pastor should be provided for the same

The war between the ceunte qf Tbufoufe and Provence, The count of Toulouse, who was rendered more ready to obey the emperor, owing to the old injuries often iniiicted on him by the French, roused himself at the summons of the emperor, and eagerly marched against the count of Provence, on whom he inflicted irreparable injuries ; the latter, however, immediately flew for protection to the French king, humbly begging him, for the honour and respect of the French queen, his daughter, to give him effectual assistance. For there were at Avignon, and especially in the provinces lying near the Rhone, some French nobles, who had come thither with Louis, the French king, and who had seized by force on some castles, towns, and cities, from the said Louis, at the instigation, and by the assistance of the pope, and still forcibly detained them from him.

The count of Toulouse, however, being aware of their plans, laid an ambuscade for them, and meeting them in great strength, slew numbers of them at the sword\'s point, and repelled their attempts at his pleasure ; and the expedition prospered so in his hands, that, in a short space of time, he took about twenty castles from the French and the count of Provence ; and after punishing the rebellious possessors of them, restored them to their former rule. The king of England writes to the emperor on behalf qf the count of Provence, The king of England, hearing that the count of Provence had sustained great loss in this destructive struggle, at the pressing instance of his queen, wrote to the emperor in a friendly way, begging him for the sake of relationship, which usually unites princes, in his imperial clemency to spare the coimt of Provence, his father- in-law. The French king makes war on the count qf lymlouse. The most potent king of the French, on hearing of such an injury being inflicted on his subjects, and thinHng that these damages were brought upon him by the emperor, burst out into violent anger, as well against the emperor as against the count of Toulouse, and wishing by all means fully to repair his losses and injuries, and to punish such temerity, by a royal warrant, and with dreadful haste, collected such an army as the nobility of France is known to be able to collect. Nevertheless, in order not to rush precipitately into the struggle, they, with all proper humility, asked of the emperor himself if this war had originated with him. In the mean time, on accoimt of the loss of his army in the Holy Land, that they might not lose the remains of it by casualties, the king of France sent seven hundred knights, with a great many more retainers, to check the attacks of the enemies of the Proven9als.

When the emperor heard of this, he grieved greatly for the Christians, although they had rejected his wholesome advice, not to sail without him ; and he immediately wrote with terrible threats to the Saracens of Damascus as well as Babylon, forbidding them, as they regarded their lives, in their daring presumption to treat with inhumanity the noble Christians, the beloved servants of God, whom they detained prisoners, lest when he came upon them in dreadful force, with his formidable and victorious eagles, they should feel the imperial vengeance, and the anger of the Romans and their emperor, whose swords had been so often stained with eastern blood.

And, although the crusaders, one and all, acquiesced in our wholesome advice and counsels and adhered to our plan, which had no underhand purpose, the present Boman pontiff putting an evil interpretation upon our words and actions--- as if danger would accrue to oxvc religion and the Catholic fidth by delaying the matter till a convenient time --- surged the crusaders by frequent warnings, commands, and threats, to make the passage ; according to the words of Scripture, \* binding heavy biuxlens on others, which he himself will not move with his finger.\' When this came to our knowledge, we, with oft-repeated entreaties, begged of the said pontiff not to trust to the mutabilities and risks of fortune such a great undertaking, which demanded deliberate coimsel, convenient time, and great preparation of men and things, and not by improvident haste to endanger the service of Jesus Christ and the assistance of the Holy Land, which had fired the hearts of us, and so many and such great people, and we recalled to his attention and memory, that to repair such a great loss after a fisdl is no easy matter.

So that, whilst the diversity of several chiefs or the indolence of one prevented them from taking advantage of opportunities, or checking the insolence of many, he would serve the interests both of the expedition and of individuals, if he reserved wholesome counsels for a more favourable moment, that abundant preparation might be made ; and under the guidance of one strenuous leader, so necessary to a multitude, the Christian religion might at one and the same time advance towards its wished-for end, and rest confidently secure of triumph. This Roman priest, however, considered all these things of little moment, and in his hatred of us, that he might bring the whole business to ruin, pertinaciously insisted on the crusaders setting sail, without considering that those who remained of the Christians in foreign parts, who, together with the enemies of the lifegiving cross, were resting peaceably according to the terms of the truce made with us, would, if the treaty was violated by. any movement of the crusaders, be exposed to the perils of the sword and of femine, as no speedy assistance could be rendered to them, or provision made for them. At length, understanding that the pope had again sent letters to the crusaders, ordering them to make the passage, we wrote word to them to march through our kingdom to their place of sailing, and that we were ready cheertUlly and liberally to assist them to the utmost of our power ; and some of them passed through our kingdom of Sicily, and hence set sail, whilst others chose to take the passage by way of Marseilles. Now, therefore, that the hand of our common enemies has triumphed over so many thousand knights devoted to the service of the Holy Land, although in the slaughter of them we should lament the disgrace brought on the mediator for mankind, Jesus Christ, and on the whole of Christianity, we, as our conscience attests, compassionate their suft\'ering injury, the more because by the loss of such a gallant soldiery the kingdom of France has suffered more severe loss t2

A senator had been created at Rome by the emperor in the third year before this, and the cardinals therefore forthwith assembled, declaring that they would no lon\^r, endure the violences of the pope, to the danger of all Chnstianity ; and they therefore signified to the pope, at the request and with the consent of the emperor, that, according to his demand, they wished a general council to be convoked and duly held as soon as possible.

A.D. 1240.\] CONSECRATION OP H. DE PATESHULL. 277 The circumcision qfa boy by the Jews, at Norwich, About this time, the Jews circumcised a Christian boy at Norwich, and after he was circumcised they called him Jumin ; they then kept him to crucify him, in contempt of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The father of the boy, however, from whom the Jews had stolen him, after a diligent search, at length discovered him, confined in custody of the Jews, and with a loud cry he pointed out his son, whom he believed lost, shut up in a room of one of the Jews\' houses. When this extraorcfinary crime came to the knowledge of William de Rele, the bishop, a wise and circumspect prelate, and of some other nobles, in order that such an insult to Christ should not be passed over unpimished, through the neglect of the Christians, all the Jews of that city were made prisoners, and when they wished to place themselves under the protection of the royal authority, the bishop said, \" These matters belong to the Church, and when the question raised is concerning circumcision and insult to religion, it is not to be decided by the king\'s court.\" Four of the Jews, therefore, having been found guilty of the aforesaid crime, were first dragged at the tails of horses, and afterwards hung on a gibbet, where they breathed forth the wretched remains of life. The consecration of H. de PateshuU, and extortion of the revenues. On the first of July in this year, Hugh de PateshuU, bishop elect of Coventry and Lichfield, was consecrated by Edmimd, archbishop of Canterbury, in the new priory near Guildford, and William de Haverhull, a canon of St. Paul\'s church at London, was appointed treasurer in the place of the said Hugh. About this time, too, a most iniquitous agreement was made between the pope and the Romans (as was reported), namely, that whatever benefices could be given away in England by the pope, especially those of religious men, should be distributed amongst the sons and relations of the Romans at their pleasure, on condition that they should all rise with one accord against the emperor, and use all their endeavours to hurl him from the imperial throne, and thus acquire for themselves the reputation of their ancient boldness. Therefore a few days afterwards the pope sent his sacred warrants to Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, and to the bishops of

Lincoln and Salisbury, ordering them to provide for three hundred Homans in the first benefices which should be vacant ; giving them to understand, that they were suspended from giving away benefices till that number were suitably provided for. At this order the hearts of all were seized with astonishment, and it was feared that he who dared to do such things would sink into the depths of despair. The archbishop of Canterbury exiles himself. Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, who had already submitted, willingly or unwillingly, to the above-mentioned hateful exactions, and paid eight hundred marks to the pope, now seeing that the English church was daily trampled on more and more, despoiled of its possessions, and deprived of its liberties, became weary of living to see such evils upon the earth. He, therefore, after having asked the king\'s permission, and gaining nothing but evasive answers, left the coimtry, provoked by these various injuries, and sailed to France, where, with a small retinue, he took up his abode at Pontigny, at which place his predecessor, St. Thomas, had dwelt in his exile, and employed himself in prayer and fasting. Certain heretical assertions. At this time a man pretending to be of an honourable and rigorous life, and with the dress and bearing of the Carthusian order, was seized at Cambridge for having reftised to enter any church ; and when questioned as to this madness, he replied in an unbecoming way, and was committed to close confinement, and a few days afterwards was sent to the legate to be imprisoned in the Tower of London. For he openly made the following declaration : --- \" Gregory is not the pope ; he is not the head of the Church ; but there is another head of the Church. The Church has been profaned, and divine services ought not to be performed in it imless it is dedicated anew ; its vessels and garments must be reconsecrated.

TAtf king tends justiciaries to make the circuit of England, The king, about this time, sent justiciaries to make the circuit of aU England, who travelled through all the counties belonging to the king, correcting the excesses of many, and under the pretext of administering justice, collected an immense sum of money for the use of the king, who squandered away everything. The southern parts of England be consigned to the scrutiny of William of York, provost of Beverley, and his followers; the northern provinces being committed to Robert of Lexington and his colleagues. About this time, too, the legate sent a large simi of money by a clerk of his named Mumel, to the pope, who received it with pleasure, and sent the messenger back to receive more. The detestable extortion ofmoney by the pope, A novel and execrable method of extortion, hitherto unheard of, sprung up at this time in England ; for our holy fiither the pope sent an extortioner, named Peter le Rouge, into England, who was skilled to extort money by the most exquisite devices from the wretched English. He went to the chapters of the religious men, compelling and seducing them to promise money, and t-o pay it when promised, like the other prelates, who he lyingly asserted had paid it willingly ; \" For,\" said he, \" such and such a bishop, and such and such an abbat, has already willingly satisfied my demands, and why do you thus idly delay, so as to lose your thanks and recompense ?\" This said impost€ff also made them swear that they would not make known to any person, within the period of half a year, the method of extorting money which he had practised.\* In doing this he followed the plan of robbers of houses, who extort a promise from the plundered party not to reveal the names of their plunderers to any one ; but although men should be silent, the stones of the churches would raise a cry against their despoilers, nor could this wicked action be kept in darkness ; for how could the prelates exact money from those subject to them, unless the reason of the demand were told 1 \* The text adds/\* Quasi eliciens hoc ex singoloram primitivapossessione, quum tantum de honestis sit consiliuin papale oelandam :\" in which there is certainly some corroption.

A.D. 1240.\] MEETING OF BISHOPS AT NOBTHAMFTON. 281 The complaint of the abbats to the king about the qforetaid exaction. The abbats therefore went to the king with mournful and dejected countenances, saying, \" Your majesty, we are beaten, and are not allowed to exclaim against it ; our throats are cut, and we cannot cry out ; impossibilities are enjoined on us by the pope, and a detestable extortion is practised on the whole world. We hold our baronies from you, and cannot impoverish them without prejudice to you, and we cannot answer to you for what is incumbent on us for them, and at the same time satisfy the unceasing extortion of the pope. For in this way sonie new and reiterated oppression devised by the Romans is always unexpectedly rising against us, which does not allow us to breathe freely even for a little time j we therefore run to the asylum of your counsels, and to your protecting bosom, and demand your advice and assistance in this state of desolation.\" Those who addressed these words to the king were the abbat of St. Edmund\'s and the abbat of Beaulieu. The king, however, when he had heard their complaint, regarded them with a scowling look, and to their great alarm called out with a loud voice to the legate, who happened to be present, \" See, my lord legate, these wretched seducers are disclosing the secrets of the pope, giving vent to reproaches, and do not acquiesce in your pleasure ; do what you please with them ; I grant you one of my best castles to impriscm them in.\" The abbats, when they heard these words, were struck with inexpressible dismay, and departed, promising to satisfy the legate to the extent of his wishes. Some, however, although but few, no longer wavered, but refused to bend their necks to the slavery of such a wretched condition, and stood firm in their refusal to pay what was demanded of them, and scarcely availed themselves of the subterfuge of asking for time to be granted them. A meeting of the bishops at Northampton on the same account. When the legate with his ally, Peter le Rouge, thought to act in the same way with the bishops, who had been summoned to Northampton for this purpose, they, having learnt experience from the case of the abbats, replied, \" We have archdeacons subject to us, who are aware of the means of the

---

282 MATTHEW PABI& \[a.D. 1240. beneficed clergy subject to them, but of which we are ignorant ; this matter concerns all parties, and all ought therefore to be convened together ; and it is neither proper nor expedient for us to give a reply without them.\" A day was therefore appointed for them to give their answer, in the octaves of the feast of St. John the Baptist, namely, on the day of his nativity. On that day, therefore, they all assembled in the presence of the legate and his associates, and being unwilling in a stiff-necked manner impudently to oppose the aforesaid exactions and to refuse consent to them, but opposing them in a modest and cautious manner, they \\/ pleaded the following reasonable objections in reply : --- Thi objeetiotu of the bithopt to the demands of the legate. They state that they ought not to contribute, both because the contribution woidd be against one who had made an alliance with their prince, and because it was made for the shedding of Christian blood, which was clear from the words of the apostolic warrant, in which were contained the words \" to make war on the emperor ;\" also, because it would be contrary to the liberty of the Church, which was also evident ftom the tenour of the same warrant, in which it was said, \" checking all opposers by the Church\'s censure,\" and this was servitude and compulsion. Further, because they had, at another time, given the tenth part of their property to the pope, with a protest against a similar exaction being made thereafter ; with much less reason, then, ought a fifth part to be now demanded ; also, because there was reason to fear that it would become a custom, as a deed twice done makes a custom, as is expressed in the code, \" Concerning episcopal audiences : iVo mem by law, &c. &c.\" Also because, as they considered it necessary to settle business at the Eoman court, to which there were no other means of access open except through the imperial territories, they should be afraid of the emperor\'s seizing them, and committing them to prison, when they would be sure of a severe puni\^d\^ent. Again, because, as the king had many enemies against whom he expected to have to sustain the burden of war, for fear of worse happening, it would not be safe to impoverish the country any more, especially as it was now in a great measure emptied of its wealth, as the nobles had set out on the

Again, that this would turn to the prejudice of the patrons of the churches, especially as it was not clear that they consented to the aforesaid contribution. Again, because the condition of the Church in general was dangerous, on which account a general consultation ought to be held, in order that a general contribution might be made in that case, if necessary, which it was not in the present case ; for the report has gained ground, that a general council will be convoked, at which such cases will be determined ; and it is necessary that such should be the case, that the general cause of offence may be removed.\" When the legate and his associates heard these objections\^ they silently concealed their confusion, but determined, whenever an opportunity offered, again to bring torward this\^ or some other exaction of a similar kind. \* The legate convokes the recton of the churches m Berkshire. The legate and his accomplices having still some hopes of bending others to their will, and inducing them to contribute, assembled the rectors of the churches of Berkshire and some others, urging them by many arguments, and adding threats to threats and promises to promises. They, however, also firmly replied that they would not recede from the terms of their reply, relying on their own argument, to which, though sufficient, we will here annex others. 7\^e replies of the qforesaid rectors respecting the contribution. Each and all of the rectors of the churches of Berkshire say that they ought not to contribute against the emperor as against a heretic, as he is not yet condemned by a judgment of the Church, nor found guilty, although he is excommunicated, and not because he takes possession of or attacks the inheritance of the Boman church, for the Church does not apply the secular arm against heretics. Again, in the same way as the Boman church has its own inheritance, the management of which pertains to the pope, other churches \^/ also have their inheritances contributed by the bounty and grants of kings, princes, and other Christian nobles, and which are in no way liable to be taxed by, or tributary to, the Boman church ; wherefore the prelates ought not to be compelled to contribute &om the inheritance of their.

284 MATTHEW PARIS. \[a.D. 1240. churches. Again, although by the letter of the law, everything is said to belong to the prince, not however by y/ dominion and proprietorship, but as regards his care and protection, so likewise the churches belong to the pope as far as regards care and protection, not by lordship and proprietorship ; wherefore they say that they ought not to be compelled to contribute. Again, as the truth says, \" Thou art Peter, and on this rock will I build my church,\" he reserved the proprietorship to himself, intrusting to Peter the care, as appears from the words of the Gospel which follow : \" Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,\" &c. &c. ; not \" whatever thou shall exact on earth shall be exacted also in heaven ;\" wherefore they say that they cannot and ought not, according to the words of the Lord and justice, to be compelled to contribute. Again, inasmuch as on the authority of the holy fathers, the produce of the churches is devoted to certain uses, namely, to the use of the church, the ministers, and the poor, it ought not to be converted to other uses imless by authority of the Church universal ; wherefore no contribution ought to be given from the goods of the Church for the purpose of making war, least of all against Christians. Again, as the proceeds of their churches are scarcely sufficient to provide daily food for the clerks, on account of their small amoimt, and because famine sometimes assails the country when the crops fail, also because there is such a great number of poor people and travellers coming to them, some of whom we have seen die for want of nourishment, and because no one can hold more than one benefice, owing to which they are the poorer, and with difficulty can supply themselves and the poor, they ought not to be compelled to contribute in such a case. Again, however good it would be for them to contribute, yet it ought and would be advantageous to let the matter drop, on account of the scandal which has arisen and been wafted abroad through the world against the Boman church ; for it is publicly stated that exactions of this kind have been made at other times, and clerks been impoverished in a most irregular way ; and as soon as the money has been exacted and extorted from them, the emperor and the pope have come to terms, and not one faitYnxig has been restored ; nay, if any balance had been left uncollected, it was rigidly exacted even

Nor is it clear or well known that any gain has accrued to the Church by extortions of this kind : God grant that it may not be to her detriment ! The enemies of the Church are strengthened and enriched thereby, and from being strong / become stronger, and it is hard for us to die by our own weapons ; wherefore we ought not to contribute. Again, as alL or nearly all, are bound by a vow to the service of the cross, to fulfil which vows themselves personally, or by other competent persons, they have received an order from the pope, they cannot at one and the same time satisfactorily perform this difficult and advantageous duty and also pay this contribution. Again, as they are protected by the privilege of those who have assumed the cross, by which the produce and incomes of their revenues are granted to them entire for three years, they ought not to contribute in this case. Again, as many are bound by the pope\'s letters to pay the monks of Clugny on a fixed day out of the tithes of their churches, to which the said monks are known to have the right of patronage, or in which they have any temporal or spiritual claim, they ought not therefore to contribute. Again, as our lord the king of England has deadly enemies on all sides, who are prepared, as is stated, to injure him, and as the kingdom is deprived of the counsel and aid of those honourable men who are making arrangements to set out to foreign parts, and who will take away with them a very large sum of money, it would not be safe to impoverish the churches and the kingdom to such a degree as not to leave sufficient means for the protection of the state; and there would be undoubted reason to fear the irreparable ruin of the kingdom. Moreover, as the clerks of the English nation were formerly richer than now, namely when they all, or at least the greater portion of them, held several benefices without a dispensation, and an exaction of this kind was never made on them, although at that time several holy fathers were sent into exile by tyrannical emperors, and

T\^e legate excitee diasentions amongst the aforesaid rectors. The legate and his accomplices finding that their firmness was supported by such sound arguments, and that they could not break them whilst thus united together, determined to cause a schism and dissensions amongst them. The legate, therefore, went to the king, and soon gained that weak man over to his wish ; his associates also went to the bishops as well as their archdeacons, especially Master Alan of Beccles, archdeacon of Sudbury, who was formerly more determined than all the rest, and to some other ambitious men who were aspiring to higher dignities, and promised them effective assistance, if they would not agree to the determination of the said community of rectors ; and thus having seduced them, the adverse party prevailed. Earl Richard and the other nobles set sail. In this year Earl Kichard, having made all the necessary preparations for his journey to Jerusalem, went to the abbey of St. Albans, and entering the chapter-house, begged the assistance of the prayers of the brotherhood ; from thence he went to London, between Ascension-day and Whit-Sunday, and bade fisirewell to the kiug, his brother, the legate, and the rest of the nobles ; after which he hastened his steps towards Dover. The king took the earVs son Henry, and also his possessions, into his care ; and the legate, and a great number of nobles, prelates, and religious men, accompanied him on his journey to the sea-coast, where they devoutly intrusted him to the Divine guidance ; Brother Theodoric, however, a prior of the Hospitallers, still attended him as his inseparable companion and guide. A gi-eat many nobles of England set \^dl about this same time ; amongst others, William / Longuespee, earl of Salisbury, and a great many others too numerous to mention, and a great many barons and knights who adhered to them as their leaders and chiefs. \\\^\'

288 MATTHEW PARIS. \[a.D. 1240\* The king of France receives Earl Richard with great honour. Earl Richard having safely arrived on the shores of the continent, entered the French territories, and made his way towards the king. As he drew near, however, the king, with his mother B. and many of his nobles, came to meet him with rejoicing, and entertained him in his palace, feasting with him as a beloved relation of his, and loading him with royal presents ; he also, on the earl\'s departure, sent his mareschal as a protector and guide to him through the whole of his territory, who bountifully and honourably supplied the necessaries for the journey, and lodgings for him and his followers, till he had safely passed the Rhone. The citizens of Avignon, too, came to meet him with great demonstrations of joy, and freely offered to procure him entertainment in their city, at their own expense. He afterwards took boats at Vienne, determining to sail down the Rhone, to the city of Aries ; but the citizens of Vienne and other neighbouring cities asked Earl Richard to sell them his passage-boats, for which they would give him three times their value ; and on the earl\'s refusing to do so, stating that he was not a merchant, they seized and detained them by force. The earl, however, much offended, pursued his journey as he could, and arrived at the city of Aries. The citizens of Vienne afterwards repenting, although late, of this enormous offence of theirs, sent the vessels, which they had taken away from the earl, to him at Beaucaire ; but the earl, in his indignation, destroyed them all. The count of Toulouse was greatly vexed at this injury having been inflicted on Earl Richard in his dominions, for they were relations. The count of Provence meets Earl Richard. The count of Provence, father of the queen of England, on being informed of the approach of Earl Richard, went from Tarascon to meet him with joy and gladness, ready to serve him, and to do him any Mndness; hoping to receive assistance from him against the count of Toulouse, with whom he was at war, and owing to whom he had undergone many dangers.

A.l\>. 1240.\] EARL BICHARD FORBIDDEN TO SET SAIL. 289 Earl Richard visiit St. Giles\* a. When Earl Richard had arrived thus far, knowing that he was not far from the city of St. Giles, he hastened thither to pay his devotions ; in order that in the same way as he had a short time before, at a general chapter of the Cistercians, commended himself in all humility to their prayers, and in his innate munificence bestowed on them a yearly income of twenty marks for the improvement of the condition of the community, so, with the favour of St. Giles, he might more safely pass through the dangers of the sea. The pope forbids Earl Richard to set sail. When Earl Richard had arrived at St. Giles\'s, he was met by a legate and the archbishop of Aries, who forbade him, by authority of the pope, to set sail ; at which the earl was greatly astonished, and replied that he once believed there was truth in the words of the ApostoHc See, and in the preachers whom it sent ; but being greatly vexed at this prohibition, he said : --- \" T have made aJl the necessary preparations for my passage, I have bidden fexewell to my friends, I have sent my money and arms in advance of me, and I have got my ships ready and loaded them with provisions, and now the tone is altered ; and just as I have arrived at the seacoast, and am about to embark, the pope, who is called the successor and vicar of Jesus Christ, who is said never to have broken his word, forbids me to proceed on the service of Christ, although I am now ready for all emergencies.\" These legates, then, seeing that they could not prevent his setting sail, advised him to leave the port of Marseilles, and to put to sea from the port of Aigues Mortes, which latter place was abhorred by the whole army, owing to its foul and sickly state, and they therefore dissuaded the earl from so doing ; he, therefore, despite the false and ambiguous arguments of the legates, and detesting the duplicity of the Roman church, with great bitterness of spirit, adhered to his purpose of sailing from Marseilles. He tAien went, in the first place, to Roche, where he prepared and loaded his ships, and also sent word to the emperor by special messengers, namely, the knight Robert de Twenge, and others, informing him of his condition, and the pope\'s VOL.

This knight, in his desire to enlarge his own territory, had often caused much injury and loss to the abbey of St. Alban\'s, whose &rms adjoined his own.

In the summer of this year, whilst Earl Richard was at London, and was discussing with the king his brother as to whether he should travel by way of Italy or Marseilles, at length, by the advice and arrangement of Brother Theodoric, prior of the Hospitallers of St. John, he decided to make the passage with this said brother as a guide, and to embark on board ship, to pass the Mediterranean Sea, and whilst this was passing in his mind, Earl G., marshal, came to the said earl and offered in his presence to clear himself of all the charges made against him, by whomsoever made, and lawfully and according to their decision to give satisfe\^tion to the king before the whole court in the matter of which he complained. Earl Richard on this interceded for him with the king, who laid aside all his former rancour and auger against him : it is, however, believed, that Earl G., marshal, obtained this favour by means of presents both to the king and Earl Richard, according to the words of the poet : --- Crede mihi, res est ingeniosa dare. \[The best of ways, you may believe, To gain a favour, is to give.\] Maurice, the justiciary , effects a reconciliation with Earl O., marshal, Maurice, the justiciary of Ireland, having been faithfully informed of all this, hastened with all speed to the king, who was then staying at London, being desirous of pacifying the feelings of Earl G., marshal, whom he knew to be excited against him on account of the death of his brother.

For he affirmed before God, that he was in no way polluted by that murder which he was accused of ha,ving committed, and by which slander his honour had been blackened in no small degree. Thus by the intervention of the king and the nobles. Earl G. was inclined to list to entreaties and reason, and as Maurice wisely humiliated himself, peace and concord was re-established between the two\* The prince qf Connaught complaifu to the king. About this same time, a certain petty prince of that part of Ireland named Connaught, came to the king at London, and laid a heavy complaint before him and his court, of the injuries inflicted on him by John de Bourg, who unceasingly devastated his territory with tire and sword. For all these injuries he now demanded justice to be done him, that the daring violence of that noble should be checked by the royal authority, and entreated of the king not to permit his faithful subject, who had paid an annual tribute of five thousand marks for his kingdom ever since he had been allowed to hold it in peace and been confirmed in it by King John, who had by force reduced him and his kingdom to subjection to him, to be deprived unjustly of his inheritance by (as he called him) an ignoble adventurer. The king giving a favourable ear to his just demands, ordered the said Maurice, who was then in his presence, to pluck up that plantation of unfruitfiil sycamores which Hubert, earl of Kent, in the ravings of his power, had planted in those provinces, and not to permit them to shoot up any further. He also wrote orders to

In this manner, by the consolations of the king, the hopes of the aforesaid prince were raised, and he returned to his own possessions. The pope endeavours to recede from his truce with the emperor. At the end of the summer, the legate, finding that the pope had agreed to a truce with the emperor, to last till the general council which was to be held at the ensuing Easter, was greatly enraged, and sent word to his holiness that he was become effeminate in mind, and pusillanimous, that his spirits were broken, and that he had sunk into despair. And not without reason, as he had in France alone already collected money enough to enable him without fear to carry on the war against the emperor for a whole year. The pope, on hearing this, repented and was sorry that he had agreed to the truce, and summoned Master John de Colonna and Master Kaymond, his chief cardinals, who had been the mediators in arranging the truce aud the intercessors with the emperor, and addressing the former of them, John, said, \'\^ I am ashamed of myself for having granted a truce to this enemy of the Church, Frederick ; do you, therefore, as you were the interpreter between us in the matter, go with all haste to him, and tell him that I do not choose to accept of the truce, and boldly defy him, and declare that I shall be his enemy henceforth, as I am now and have been formerly.\" To this John replied, \" Far be it that there should be such fickleness of speech in the mouth of such a great man, and that they should be sent to such a great prince, especially by us who are not considered common persons ; and to this fickle and faithless plan I will on no account consent, but firmly oppose it.\" The pope then said, \" I no longer consider you as my cardinal ;\" to which John replied, \" And I will no longer esteem you as pope.\" In this manner he went away, and from a friend became an enemy; in the same manner as / when a certain unjust emperor said to one of his senators, \" Depart, you are no longer my senator ;\" to which the senator boldly replied, \"And you are no longer my emperor ;\" for in the same way as the subject is bound to his lord, so the lord is bound to the subject. y\^

A.\]\>. 1240.\] BIUOENCE OF THE LEGATE. 299 How the legate amassed a large sum o/money in France, When this became known to the French king\^ he ordered the whole of the money which the legate had, with his permission, gathered in his territories, extorting it from the clerical community by honeyed words and bitter threats, to be kept back until he should see the issue of the event, in order that the pope, who was called the vicar of Christ on earth, might at least prove true to his word in this case. The truce therefore still continued inviolate between them, except as regarded the enemies of the emperor, namely the Milanese and some other Italian people, about whom it was not the pope\'s business to be anxious, afi it had been settled at first in drawing up the treaty. The pope\* s craftiness in exacting money in England, The pope, who carefully watched every chance of amassing money, expecting the wished-for booty from England, sent word to the legate, not to attempt to convene the whole of the clergy together, as formerly, that they might not be encouraged one by the other, and relying on tneir former reasons and objections, again oppose his designs ; but rather to summon each of them, one by one, and endeavour thus to bend them to his will, first weakening the firmness of the king, that he, who had formerly stood by the clergy and given it horns, might become weak to its ruin. The diligence of the legate in collecting money. On receipt of this message, the legate, from being skilful in injury, became more skilful ; and, by authority of the pope, summoned the whole body of the clergy of England to appear before him, at London, on All Saints\' day. On the appointed day, therefore, all the clergy and religious men assembled, when they found the king opposed to them as an open enemy, for he was become to them, as it were, the stalk of a reed --- on which those who lean in confidence, are \^ wounded by the fragments of it. The religious men, therefore, as well as the archdeacon and beneficed clergy, who had come there to oppose the legate to his fiice, and who were animated by a prompt spirit to appeal to the approaching coimcil, seeing that they were become as sheep delivered to the bloody jaws of wolves, yielded their consent to the

The death of the monks of Durham at Rome, About this time, the monks of Durham, who were staying at Rome, to obtain a confirmation of their election, suffered much harm, owing to the impediments thrown in the way of completing their business by the king, so that being wearied by suspense, they pined away, as it were, with grief, and fall/ ing sick, took to their beds ; fulfilling the words of Solomon, \>\^ who says, \" A broken spirit drieth up the bones.\" Four of those who were staying there died, who had been selected from the rest of their brethren as being considered more prudent than the rest, as well as some clerks and attendants skilled in the law, who had been deputed to attend them for their consolation and comfort ; and thus the most influential party of the convent perished, whether by casual disease, or sadness of spirit, by pestilence, or poison, is unknown. When the prior of Durham, the bishop elect, heard of this event, he was overcome with sorrow, and was horror-struck, because, although the king was the chief cause of it, for not allowing vacant churches to be ordained, yet he seemed to have been the occasion of such a great misfortune ; he, therefore, at once voluntarily resigned the station, declaring that he should never recover his former state of joy and cheerfulness. The monks, then, being thus left at liberty to elect another prelate, went to the king, in the usual way, and asked him to grant them proper facilities for electing one, which request the king granted ; but at the same time, as the poet says, --- Imperium, promissa, preces, confudit in unum. \[With mixed commands, and promises, and prayers, At once the lord and suppliant he appears.\] He most earnestly begged of them to nominate and elect Master Peter d\'Aigueblanche, bishop elect of Hertford, a yr Proven9al by birth, or else Bonifacius, the queen\'s uncle, of \^ the morals and knowledge of which two men they were totally ignorant ; but they knew that they were both of foreign extraction, and incompetent for such a station ; and there was no necessity for England, which often supplied fit persons for the government of churches in other countries,

After the completion of this superstitious act, their high priest, with a dejected look and mournful voice, thus addressed the chiefs : --- \" Be it known to your high mightinesses, that the fates are averse to us.\" And then taking up a parable, and imbibing the inspiration of the unclean spirit, he continued the discourse which he had begun, saying, \" Let not the victory lately given to you by the gods, elate or exalt you too much, for there are those approaching who will boldly require the blood of the conquered at your hands, with the vengeance of ample retribution.\" At hearing this, his auditors were astounded, and one of the principal chiefii asked of the aforesaid conjurer, who was the chief of the Christian army, to which he received for \\ reply, \" It is a certain young man, whose coming is about to I / take place immediately.\" The chief then said to the sor- ; \^ cerer, \" Is he of the family of that illustrious king who some time ago struck terror into the whole of the East 1\" The sorcerer replied, \" He is the grandson of that king, and bears his name.\" \" And what are his morals ?

And as he had obtained a dispensation to hold several benefices, the pope, that he might not appear to lav his hand on him too heavily, although no one appeared as intercessor for the said Simon, Hmited the amount of his revenue to a hundred thousand marks.

In the first place, then, the emperor complained of the inopportune and too sudden time, to the settling of which he had never consented.

The death of Edmund\^ archbishop of Canierbury, Whilst the wheel of fortune was thus changeably agitating the course of worldly events, Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, who had gone voluntarily into exile on the continent, pined away both in body and mind, and with frequent sighs continually exclaimed, \" Oh ! how much better would it be to die than to see the sufferings of one\'s people and of the saints, upon earth.\" For those whom he had bound, the legate, without regard to his own dignity, and to his own disfavour, absolved, and vice versa. In his desire, therefore, for his dissolution, and to be with Christ, he prayed as follows : \*\* Woe is me that my exile has been prolonged ; it is already sufficient, and more than sufficient, that I have seen all things involved in destruction and ruin : take my life, oh Lord my God !\" The said archbishop had been staying for some days at Pontigny, where his predecessor, the blessed • martyr Thomas, had some time before dwelt during his exile ; and at this place, with tears and fasting, he day and night offered up prayers to God and the blessed Thomas, for the condition of the English church, which was in such imminent peril. Being at length exhausted by abstinence, and worn away by grief, his body being empty, shrunk, and weakened, he fell seriously ill there, and by the advice of his physicians he caused himself to be conveyed, for the sake of inhaling a better air, to Soissy, where, after languishing for some time under dysentery, he was released from the bonds of the flesh, he bade farewell to this wicked world, and went the way of all flesh ; and his spirit thus happily exchanged exile in this life for the heavenly country. Truly indeed was he an exile ; his body only made pilgrimage in this life, and he languished \^ under many causes of annoyance. The rebels against the Church, whom he had judicially excommunicated, the legate contumaciously and irreverently absolved, and, by the consent or permission of the king, rashly presumed to perform many other acts which did not pertain to his office, to the prejudice of the said archbishop, the primate of all England. This source of annoyance, however, forcibly excited the prelates of England, and a certain satirist, when the king and the

During his stay there in his lifetime, the monks, at one time, thought that he was going away from them ; on which the prior of the place said to him, \" Why do you go away firom us, my lord ? \"Why do you abandon us t You will be harassed with the journey ; rest in peace with us.\" To this the archbishop replied, \" My heart will remain with you \^\" but they did not understand his speech ; he, however, was taken ill and died there, and his body having been cut open, his entrails and his heart were buried there. That place is twenty leagues, that is, two days\' journey, distant from Pontigny ; and thus, at length, their eyes were opened, and they understood the meaning of the words which the archbishop had spoken. TTia clerks and attendants then had his sacred body clothed (as was the custom) in his pontifical robes, carried to Pontigny on a wooden conveyance, to be there buried. For he had, during his life, when he saw that he should soon depart this world, commended his cause to God and Saint Thomas (who, when / exiled firom England for the same cause as himself had found an asylum there), and bequeathed his body to the church of Pontigny. Whilst they were on their journey carrying his holy body to be buried, the sick, on account of the feme of his sanctity, flocked to it, confidently begging to be restored to health by Christ, through his prayers ; and on one day the Lord, owing to his great merits, deigned three times maniy festly to signalize the holy man, for his great merits, with \^ great miracles, and a title of sanctity ; for which the hjrmn of the angels, \" We praise thee, oh G

And all this the said martyr Thomas had openly foretold. \>/\\/ The prelates qf England set out to Rome. During all these various changes of events, the emperor retracted from his observance of the truce agreed on, as the pope had previously done ; he also cruelly harassed the city, which he was besieging. The prelates of England, however, and the legate, in obedience to the pope\'s commands, boldly prepared, although at great risk to themselves, to cross the Alps at the ensuing Christmas. Peter d\* Aiguehlanche consecrated bishop of Hertford, About this time, on the Sunday next before Christmas, Master Peter d\'Aigueblanche was consecrated bishop of Hertford, in St. Paul\'s church at London, in the presence of the king and nobles, and amidst the plaudits of the multitude. At the same time the monks of Canterbury urged their claim to exercise the privileges of their church to the legate and the archbishop of York, as well as to the other prelates and nobles, who were there present. • Our hordes crown qf thorns brought to France\* In this year France flourished and exulted in reiterated j&vours of our Lord Jesus Christ ; for besides being rewarded with the body of the confessor Edmund, who had removed himself from England, it was rejoiced by obtaining our Lord\'s crown of thorns, obtained at Constantinople. For at a time of necessity, and when money was deficient (a common case with those who carry on war), Baldwin, emperor of Constantinople, sent word to the French king, that as he was entirely destitute of money, if he, the French king, would give hun effectual pecuniary assistance, he, the said emperor, would, in consideration of his old ties of friendship and relationship, give him the veritable crown of our Lord, which the Jews had woven and placed on his head when about to suffer on the cross for the redemption of the human race.

In return for this great benefit obtained from the king, the emperor, according to his promises and agreements, faithfully sent to him the crown of Christ, precious beyond gold or topaz ; it was therefore solemnly and devoutly received, to the credit of the French kingdom, and indeed of all the Latins, in grand procession, amidst the ringing of bells and the devout prayers of the faithful followers of Christ, and was placed with due respect in the king\'s chapel at Paris.

And if they only pretended to fight, or perhaps warned their countrymen to fly, the Tartars following in their rear, slew them ; and if they fought bravely and conquered, they gained no thanks by way of recompense, and thus these savages illtreated their captives as though they were horses.

But the reply to this is, that it nevertheless is probable that they are some of those who were inclosed in the mountains, of whom mention has been before made. And as in the time of the government of Moses their rebellious hearts were perverted to an evil way of thinking, so that they followed after strange gods and unknown customs, so now in a more wonderful manner, owing to the vengeance of God, they were unknown to every other nation, , and their heart and language was confused, and their life V changed to that of the cruel and irrational wild beast.

A remarkable battle amongst the fishes in the sea. Although other great and unheard-of wonders happened in this year, we have thought it worth our while to mention in this work one more remarkable than the rest. As it is the nature of the sea to vomit up on dry land the dead bodies thrown into it, about eleven whales, besides other marine monsters, were cast up on the seacoast of England, dead, as if they had been injured in some kind of struggle --- not, however, by the attacks or skill of man. The sailors and old people, dwelling near the coast, who had seen the wonders of the deep when following their vocation in the vast waters, and trafficking to distant countries, declared that there had been an unusual battle amongst the fishes, beasts, and monsters of the deep, which by wounding and gnawing each other, had caused death to several ; and those which had been killed had been cast ashore. One of the fishes, a monster of prodigious size, made its way into the Thames, and with difficulty passed uninjured between the pillars of the bridge ; it was carried as far as a manor of the king\'s called Mortlake, where it was followed by a number of sailors, and at length killed, after a great deal of trouble, by innumerable blows of spears. Of this event, a certain versifier jestingly remarked, --- Venerat ad funus Thetidis de piscibus unus, Quern rex Neptunus misit quasi nobile munos. \[To Thetis\' funeral came a monster fish. By Neptune sent to make a glorious dish.\]

Theprefffumey qf the empress. About this time the emperor began to conceive a particular regard for the English above all other nations, for the sake of the Empress Isabella, sister of the king of England, who by her excelling beauty and manners procured the favour of all ; moreover, she was now pregnant, and again gave hopes to her august spouse of a further increase of his family ; but under an unlucky star, events turned out far otherwise than \^ was expected, as the following narrative will more fully relate. How the iing placed the legate in the royal seat. Anno Domini 1241, which was the twenty-fifth year of the reign of King Henry the Third, the said king held his court at Christmas, at Westminster, in London, where a great many nobles of the kingdom celebrated the festival of the Lord\'s Nativity with him. On Christmas-day, the king, at the instance of the legate, whom he used his utmost endeavours to please, conferred the honour of knighthood on the nephew of the said legate, who was named Advocate, and at once gave him an income of thirty pounds, which the said newly-instaUed knight immediately sold, as he knew that he should soon have to leave the kingdom with his master ; and on the same day, also, the king honoured a native of Provence with the Imight\'s belt, and enriched him with a large revenue. After service had been performed in the church, the king, when about to take breakd\^ist in the large palace of Westminster, notwithstanding the scowling looks of many present, placed the legate whom he had invited to break&st with him, in the highest seat at table, namely in his own royal seat, which is at the middle of the table, he himself taking his seat at the legate\'s right hand, whilst the archbishop of Tork sat on his lefb, and the prelates and other nobles taking their places in order, according to their rank and authority, by the wish of the king, who had thus arranged the order of the feast. On the £\>urth day after

Q CliTistmas, the legate, having been summoned by the pope to proceed without fail to the Koman court, sent for all the English prelates, and bade them farewell, after which he started on his journey to cross the Alps. He was conducted as &r as the seacoast by the king in great pomp, amidst the sound of trumpets, and attended by an innumerable host of nobles. When they were obliged to part, the king and the legate separated with mutual expressions of grief at being so soon disunited, although the aforesaid legate had now protracted his stay in England for a period of three years; to the irreparable injury of the Church. J%e departure of the legate Otto from England, On the day after the Epiphany, the legate, after receiving an embrace and kisses from the king, took ship at Dover, and, laying aside the insignia of his legateship, turned his back on England, leaving no one except the king, and those whom he had fattened on the property of the kingdom, to i/ lament his departure. And at that time (as was truly stated) there was not left in England so much money (with the exception of the vessels and ornaments of the holy churches) as he, the said legate, had extorted from the kingdom. He had, moreover, given away at his own will, or at that of the pope, prebends, churches, and more than three hundred rich revenues, owing to which the kingdom was like a vineyard exposed to every passer-by, and which the wild boar of the \\/\^ woods had laid waste, and languished in a miserable state of desolation. He left the church of Canterbury, which was the most noble of all the English churches, in a state of inquietude and languishing in widowhood, as well as many other cathedral and conventual churches destitute of all comfort and consolation. And he had not strengthened any of the weaker parts of the coimtry, as was proved by clear evidence, because he was sent, not to protect the sheep which were lost, but to gather in the harvest of money which he i/\^ had found. Therefore, as his deserts merited, he was, by the well-prepared plans of the emperor, deservedly despoiled of his prey, and from being the spoiler was himself spoiled, \^/ according to the words of the prophet, \" Woe to thee who spoilest; shalt thou not be despoUed?\" But these events . will be more fully related hereafter in their place. \^

1/ ;52U MATTHEW PAItI& \[a.D. 1241. Peter of Savoy comes to England, About the same time, Peter of Savoy, the queen\'s uncle, on whom the king had bestowed the earldom of Richmond, came to England, as he perceived that it was such a profitable country. The king went to meet him on his arrival, and received him with inexpressible joy, intrusted himself / and his possessions to his counsels, and also enlarged his \^ lands by the gifb of several more. Continued storms of wind. About the same time, particularly on the day of our Lord\'s Circumcision, and for several successive days, a wind from the north, beyond measure violent, caused irreparable damage, both by land and sea, bringing destruction on buildings and forests, and threatening imminent danger to those sailing on the sea ; so that the disturbed state of the elements seemed well suited to the state of the human race. Peter of Savoy is created a knight. On St. Edward\'s day, which the king makes a practice of observing with extraordinary veneration and honour, he, in order to give a still more religious character to the day, conferred the honour of knighthood on the aforesaid Peter of Savoy and fifteen other illustrious youths, in the church of St. Peter at \"Westminster. And on the day after, which was the day of the Epiphany, in honour of the said Peter, he, together with a great number of guests, celebrated their initiation with a rich and costly banquet. The citizens of London, too, were summoned by the royal warrant to be present, and some, who were called the mayors of the city, were compelled, under penalty of a fine of a hundred shillings, to come there dressed out for a feast, or as if to celebrate a marriage. The election qf Nicholas qfFamham to the see of Durham, About this time, the monks of Durham, after much useless trouble and great expenditure of money, on the resignation of the prior of Durham, who had been elected by them, which thus quashed his election, invoked the fiivour of the Holy Spirit, and unanimously elected Master Nicholas de Famham, a man of laudable morals and knowledge, as their bishop and pastor of their souLs. This said Nicholas had

A.D. 1241.\] ELECTION OF THE BISHOP OP DURHAM. 321 been Rector \* in Arts at Paris, for several years ; he afterwards practised the art of medicine at Bologna, in which he became pre-eminently distinguished, and obtained great favour by his skill After he had become perfect master of logic, and physical and natural science, he turned his attention to spiritual medicine, namely theology, and so groimded himself in that science by his learning and reading of books, that he was qualified to sit in the professorial chair. When he had thus become experienced, and had greatly distinguished himself by his knowledge and praiseworthy mode of life, the king and queen, by the advice of some learned men, and especially at the instance of Otto the legate, the bishop of Carlisle, and some other of the king\'s secret advisers, summoned him to take the charge of their souls and bodies, and to be their familiar coimsellor, in which office he conducted himself well and prudently till he was elected to the said pontifical dignity, to which election, however, he did not agree. For it seemed to him to be dishonourable to him to consent to this election, since, a little while before, when he was elected to the bishopric of Coventry, he had protested against that election, and refiised to agree to it on any account. In order, therefore, to stop the mouths of evil speakers, who would perhaps say, \" See what a hypocrite he is, he retused a poor bishopric, because he expected a richer one ;\" he resisted the offer with his utmost efforts, imtil at length R., bishop of Lincoln, reproached him severely for so doing, and effectually persuaded him to consent, by the following arguments : \" Behold, the monks of Durham and their church are deprived of a pastor, and with gushing tears beg for comfort ; why, therefore, do you not consent when you are canonically elected ? I adjure you by the shedding of the blood of Jesus Christ, to undertake the burden, and accept the honour of this office ; for the king will not, unless he is absolutely foolish, on any account disapprove of your election : and if you do not consent to it, the king, in his machinations, will place some \^ foreign and unworthy, as well as ignorant man, in the office, \\/ to the subversion of the ecclesiastical dignity, and the danger of the whole kingdom, as the bishopric of Durham is on the confines of the langdoms of England and Scotland, and the \* Perhaps something the same as Master of Arts in the present day.

The Jews are mtdeted in a sum of money. In the same year, the Jews were compelled to pay a heavy sum as redemption-money, namely, about twenty thousand marks, at two periods of this year, imder penalty of banishment or perpetual imprisonment. Preparations for a tournament. In this year Peter of Savoy, earl of Eichmond, held a tournament cL Vout/rance against Earl Bigod, in order that the foreigners might try their strength with the English, to see which of them were superior in a tUting-match. When the king heard of this, he began, by bribes and threats, to corrupt and influence the hearts of many of the more noble V and powerful English, who favoured the party of Earl Bigod, in order that the party of the foreigners might prevail Amongst these the chiefe were John Bisett, the high forester of England, and many of his associates, and Gilbert Bassett, a most brave knight, -v\^th his retainers, and many others, too numerous to mention. The result was, that, owing to the king\'s machinations, when the time for holding the tournament drew near, notwithstanding G., earl marshal, and a powerful party of the English nobility had imited themselves together, the party of the foreigners seemed stronger and more numerous ; at which the English were greatly annoyed, and conceived the greatest indignation against the contrivers of such baseness, detesting the mean wavering of their coimtrymen. The king, then, listening to wise counsel, and repenting that he had wished foreigners to triumph in the martial sport rather than his own subjects, sent

Death of G. Baa\^ett and his son. In the autumn of the same year, as Gilbert Bassett was hunting in a wood, he, together with his horse, fell over the trunk of a tree lying in his way, broke his bones and so shocked his nerves, that it caused his death a few days afterwards. Soon afterwards also, the only son and heir of the said G., a child, departed this life in the octaves of the Assumption of St. Mary, to the grief and dismay of the whole of his family ; and the inheritance consequently devolved on Fulk Bassett, dean of Tork, brother of the said G.

At the same time also, namely in the octaves of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, John Bisett, high forester of England, whom we have mentioned before, went the way of all flesL Some qfthe nobles of England set out fur Jerusalem, As the season was at this time favourable, William de Fortibus, earl of Albemarle, a bold knight ; Peter de Maidac, a Poictevin by birth, and who had for a length of time been educated and enriched under the protection of King John ; Evelyn de Eochfort, a Poictevin also; John Ansard, Alexander EGlton, Geoffrey Chandelers, and many other nobles of England, took leave of their Mends, and commending themselves to the prayers of the religious men, set out in great pomp on their way towards Jerusalem, and embarking at the Mediterranean Sea in autumn, sailed forth on their voyage across the sea. The king of France shows the cross and croum of our Lord to the people. In this year the holy cross of our Lord, which, after the time of Saladin, had remained at Damietta until the unfortunate battle, in which that city had been first gained and afterwards lost, when it fell into the hands of the Saracens, was brought into the kingdom of France, by the agency of the French king and his mother, Blanche, and by the grace of Christ seconding their pious wishes : they gave a large «um of money in order to obtain possession of the same. y2

324 MATTHEW PA1US. \[a.D. 1241. When this cross was first sold, it was bought by the Venetians for twenty thousand pounds, and they obtained it from the two sons of J., king of Jerusalem, who wanted money to make war on tKe Greeks ; and afterwards Baldwin pawned it for a still larger sum of money, and lastly sold it to Louis, the French king. On the Friday next preceding Easter-day, on which day our Lord Jesus Christ was nailed to the lifegiving-cross for the redemption of the world, this said cross was carried to Paris from the church of St. Antoine, where it had been placed on a vehicle of some kind, on which the king mounted with the two queens, namely, B., his mother, and M., his wife, and his brothers, and in the presence of the archbishops, bishops, abbats, and other religious men, as well as the French nobles, and surrounded by a countless host of people, who were awaiting this glorious sight with great joy of heart, raised the cross above his head with tears, whilst the prelates who were present cried with a loud voice, \" Behold the cross of our Lord.\" After all had worshipped it with due reverence and devotion, the king himself, barefooted, ungirt, and with his head bare, and after a fest of three days, following the example of the noble triumpher, the august HeracKus, carried it in wool to the cathedral church of the Blessed Virgin at Paris ; the brothers of the king, too, after having purified themselves by similar acts of devotion, by confessions, fasting, and prayers, followed him on foot with the two queens. They also carried the crown of thorns (which divine mercy had, as has been before stated, given to the kingdom of France the year before), and raising it on high on a similar vehicle to the other, presented it to the gaze of the people. Some of the nobles supported the arms of the king and his brothers, whilst carrying this pious burden, lest they should become fiitigued by holding their hands constantly raised, and give way beneath this priceless treasure. This was done circumspectly at the wish of the prelates, that so holy a thing might be handled reverently by those whose prudent conduct had gained so much glory, after the example of Heraclius, whom we have before mentioned. When they arrived at the cathedral church, all the bells in the dty were set ringing, and after special prayers had been solemnly read, the king returned to his great palace, which is in the middle of the city, carrying his cross\^ his brothers carrying the erown,

Thus, therefore, our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings, the Lord of lords, whose judgments are a great deep, in whose hands are the hearts of kings, giving health to whomsoever he wills, in a short space of time endowed and enriched the kingdom of France with these three precious gifts, namely, the aforesaid crown and cross of our Lord, of which we have now made mention, and the body of the blessed Edmund of Canterbury, the archbishop and confessor, which was now manifestly shining forth with unusual miracles. \\/ The French king therefore ordered a chapel of handsome structure, suitable for the reception of his said treasure, to be built near his palace, and in it he afterwards placed the said relics with due honour. Besides these the French king had, in his beautiftd chapel at Paris, the garment belonging to Christ, the lance, that is to say, the iron head of the lance, and the sponge, and other rehcs besides ; on which account the pope granted an indulgence of forty days to all who went to them in the chapel at Paris for the sake of paying their devotions. Death of the king of Denmark and his son. In this year, too, Waldemar, king of Dacia, who had presumptuously threatened to invade England, and boastingly indulged in lofty talk, was taken from amongst men, after having reigned for forty years. And in order that he might feel the effects of the prayers of St. Edward, which that saint had poured forth to God for the protection of the English against the tyranny of the Danes, his only son, the heir of all his possessions, went the way of all flesh; thus rendering the kingdom of Dacia entirely desolate. This Danish king, Waldemar,\* was in his hundredth year when he died : he had reigned over the Danes for forty years, and during his whole life, from the time when he was capable of bearing arms, continued to persecute the infidels in Scythia, Friesland, and Russia ; and during his life he gained six large bishoprics, ♦ The Latin has \*\* Ethelmar,\" evidently a \'mistake.

In this year also, Walter De Lacy, a man most distinguished amongst all the nobles of Ireland, passed from this life, after haying lost his sight, and endured many other bodily afflictions. A womdafid WMum by night. About this time a vision appeared by night to a certain priest, a wise and holy man, wherein an archprelate, dressed in pontifical robes, and carrying a cross in his hand, came to the walls which the king had at that time bnilt near the Tower of London, and, after regarding them with a scowling look, stmck them strongly and violently with the cross, saying, \" Why do ye rebtuld them f \" Whereupon the newlyerected walls suddenly feU to the ground, as if thrown down by an earthquake The priest, frightened at tins sight, said to a clerk who appeared following the archprelate, \" Who is this archbishop)\" to which the derk replied, \^It is St. Thomas the martyr, a Londoner by biri\^ who considered that these walls were bnilt as an insult, and to the prejudice ot the Londoners, and has therefore iireparably destroyed them.\" The priest then said, \*\* What expense and builders\* labour have they not cost\" The derk replied, \" If poor artificers, who se\^ after and have need of pay, had obtained food for themselves by the work, that wocdd be endurable ; but inasmuch as they have been built, not for the defence of the kingdom, but only to oppress harmless dtizens, if St. \"- Thomas had not destroyed them, St. Edmund the confessor and his successor would still more relentlessly have overthrown them from their foundations.\" The priest, after having seen these things, awoke from his deep, rose from his bed, and, in the dead solence of the night, told his vision to all who were in the house. Early in the morning a report spread through the dty of London that the walls built round the Tower, on the construction of which the king had expended more than twelve thousand marks, had fidlen to

At this time also the king took by force from the mayor of London an annual revenue of forty poimds, which each mayor had been accustomed, during his own time, to receive yearly for the honourable support of his dignity, from the commonwealth of the city, as if from a repubHc. For it had been intimated to him, the king, that the mayor of the city, under pretence of making that collection which was limited to certam terms, laid his hands heavily on the poor citizens, more than he was allowed to do, and secretly laid up money for himself in his own coffers. He therefore compelled Gerard Bat, the then mayor, to make oath, that he himself would not again collect and receive that tax, nor permit any other person, as far as he coiJd prevent it, to collect it for him. This took place in St. Stephen\'s chapel at Westminster. Not long after this, the citizens of London, contrary to the custom and liberty of the city, and like slaves of the basest condition, were compelled, although unwillingly and reluctantly, to pay a sum of money to the king, not under the name and title of voluntary aid, but of talliage ; and this impost \^ weighed very heavily upon them. The emperor forbidt the prelates to assemble at the council. About this time, the emperor, cunningly enough considering that, if a general council was held, over which his deadly enemy, the pope, had to preside, whom all the prelates were bound to obey, as limbs subservient to their head, he

---

328 MATTHEW PABI& \[A.D. 1241. would have great cause to fear, began to reflect and to devise precautions for himself ; he therefore said to his nobles : --- \" I am harassed and tormented on every side, and surrounded by divers troubles, owing to the perils now impending over the empire. For, if the general council, as it is now arranged, shoiJd be held, and my deadly enemy, whom the president prelates subject to him will not dare to gainsay, presides over it, he will irrevocably ruin me, as well as the empire. For the pope is an insatiable and open enemy of mine, and is able to depose any one who opposes his will, from his rank ; yea, and after deposing him, to pronounce the anathema against him, and to disgrace him by a worse punishment j far otherwise, also, is our cause and the condition of the empire endangered, as well as that of all princes, which I alone am bound to defend. The kings and princes of the world, whose cause also I espouse, as having become their advocate, would not come at my summons, or obey me ; and they are not subject to me so that I could force them to come, or punish them if they were contumacious. Being destitute, therefore, of their presence and assistance, shall I intrust the righteous cause of the empire to a suspicious court, and shall its enemies be its judges ? Not so, whilst I live.\" His nobles, coinciding in these reasons and arguments, determined, that, although it might seem to redound to the injury of their honour, that the foregoing plan shoiJd be altered, yet on account of the imminent danger to the empire already spoken of, the council before agreed to shoiJd be prevented. The emperor, therefore, at once, by his letters, warned the prelates not on any account to come to the general council, at the pope\'s summons; and from that time, if any prelates going to the Eoman court, and who refused to obey his orders, passed through his territory either in person or sent their proxies, he continually obstructed their progress, attacked them, seized and imprisoned them, tortured them, and several of them he punished by a dreadful death ; which circumstances reaching the pope\'s knowledge, he reiterated his maledictions and reproaches against the emperor, heaped excommunications upon him, and renewed the anathemas against him. The legates, therefore, whom the pope, the father of all spiritual matters, had \'\'\^red on their obedience to assemble at the ensuing r --- \^the feast of our Lord\'s Resurrection --- \^to attend the

And the pope, to comfort the hearts of the wavering prelates, only afforded them the meagre consolation, contained in the words of the following letter : --- The pope\* 8 letter, \" Gregory, bishop, servcmt of the servants of God, to such cmd such a bishop, health and the apostolic benediction. --- The boat of Peter, as it were, overwhelmed by the billows of worldly things, and tossed by the gust of urgent matters of doubt and difficulty, implores the assistance of the right hand of the Saviour, Jesus. For whilst it is driven onward by the blasts of the north wind, the Lord seems to be sleeping ; the disciples are in a state of doubt ; the sailors fear the wind, and its consequence, which is shipwreck, as it were ; the people are in alarm, and Peter cries, --- \* WoiJd that, though others grow cold, my children would at least give aid, and the benefit of their wholesome advice, that the billows may not overwhelm it, nor cruel pirates seize upon it.\' Moreover, by the rupture of the natural compact, confidence is shaken, charity grows cold, devotion waxes cool, iniquity increases and gains strength against the Lord, and against one\'s neighbour ; and from these causes an evident obstacle is thrown in the way of promoting the Christian faith ; losses follow, and the devout host of the true Christian, being excluded from the benefits of peace, is harassed by divers troubles. Wherefore, the Apostolic See, in its authority and dignity, after carefully weighing all these matters in the scale of the common opinion, and after due discussion and examining into them, has, in order that she, the general and only mother, may provide for the welfare of all, determined with good cause to call for the help of the hands of all powerful Christians --- such as kings, prelates, chiefs, and others of the true faith --- \^that by reiterated cries she may arouse the sleeping Lord, and, aided by the advice of numbers, may make the oppressing burdens lighter, and be able happily to reach the wished-for harbour.

AJD, 1241.\] SX7FFERIK0S OF THE CITT OF FAENZA. S31 The sufferings of the city ofFaema, At this time, the emperor, who had for a length of time besieged the city of Faenza, in Italy, had reduced it to such straits, that those of the besieged who formerly were stronger and richer than the rest, had now become poor and weak ; and now, in order that the common people might not consume their com, which was almost failing them, to no purpose, they forced them to leave the city by the gates and posterns ; for they were pining away in themselves trom hunger and manifold other wants. Afterwards, being more severely pressed by hunger, they, in the agony of their minds, obliged their wives, children, and female servants, by force to leave the city. The women, thinking to obtain mercy from the emperor, went before him with loose and disordered hair, prostrated themselves before his camp with wailing, and begged of him in his imperial mercy to show mercy to their husbands. But, although the emperor heard them, he did not grant their petition ; but replied with great indignation, --- \" Let them go to their husbands and their masters, whom I denounce as guilty of treason before Crod and man ; and, as some time since they showed me no mercy, it is imjust that they should receive mercy. For when some time since I was shut up in their city, with the gates secured both before and behind me, they suddenly entered into a conspiracy, and proposed to kill me, and basely murdered some other man like me, who was clad in imperial armour, thinking undoubtedly that they had killed me, their lord. They also olFered dishonour and manifold insults to my mother, for, as she was passing through their city, they disrespectfully mutilated the palfrey on which she rode, venting their rage on a brute animal, and showing no consideration for her royal rank, or even her sex ; it is, therefore, but just that they shoiJd meet with retaliation.\" Having thus thundered forth his determination against them, he ordered these feeble women, fainting as they were almost from want, to be driven back into the city they had left. When the citizens learned the result, they knew that their destruction was certain; they therefore sent some venerable men as special messengers, who with tears oflfered their submission to the emperor, and begged of him but to

To their supplications, however, the emperor replied : --- \" Inasmuch as they would not in their prosperity return to their allegiance, and acknowledge me as their Ibrd, I will not give heed to them \\/ when crying out in their time of trouble. For whosoever, when he can do so, offends as far as he is able, should justly be punished with the most severe possible punishment.\" When the citizens heard this, they sank into the depths of despair, and were now oppressed with more severe sorrow, and without any hopes of remedy in the now desolate state of their city. The Roman court likened to a harlot. About this time, either with the permission or by the . instrumentality of Pope Gregory, the insatiable cupidity of the Koman court grew to such an extent, confoimdmg right with wrong, that, laying aside all modesty, like a common brazen-faced strumpet, exposed for hire to every one, it considered usury as but a trivial offence, and simony as no crime \^ at all ; so that it infected other neighbouring states, and even the purity of England, by its contagion. Although the examples of this which offer themselves aboimd, I have thought proper briefly to relate one, in order to show how y justly, although tardy, the anger of God was kindled against the said court. The pope demands a revenue of a hundred marks from the monks of Peterborough. Pope Gregory, wishing to aid one of his special partisans, sent letters into England, which pressed heavily upon some of the churches. At this time, an apostoHc message, accompanied by mixed entreaties and threats, was sent to the abbat and conventual assembly of Peterborough, ordering them to give to the pope an annual revenue to the value of at least a hundred marks for each church, the patronage of which belonged to them ; and if it were worth twice as much, it would please him well. He, the pope, woiJd then grant that church to them to be held from him on an annual £ELrm, on condition that they would each year pay him a

And in order that he might the more easily incline the aforesaid abbat and monks to agree to this arrangement (or, rather, pernicious compact --- simony, / and secret fraud), as if it were necessary for their welfare, his holiness wrote to some clerks from his side the Alps, who held good benefices in England, ordering them, by the power granted to them, effectually to advise the said abbat and monks to consent to this ; and, if necessary, to compel them to it. They, therefore, in obedience to the pope\'s commands, went to Peterborough, aiid summoning the monks, said to them : --- \" Behold, friends arid brethren, a benefit is about to be conferred on you, at the powerful hands of the pope. For he now asks of you, what you ought with bended knees and clasped hands most himibly to beg of him.\" And after having explained all that the pope asked of the monks, they promised, as if they would be security and Mthfiil agents, on the pope\'s behalf, that they woiJd fulfil all his promises, provided that they, the monks, would grant what was asked privately, and, as it were, without scandal, --- \^thus making a virtue of necessity. The monks replied that they could not . do this without the permission of the king, who was their \^ patron, and the foimder of their church, as well as of many others in this country. The clerks, however, earnestly begged that this should be done secretly, hoping to do the same in other churches, and to make this a precedent ; but the monks did not choose to be overreached by their £Edlacious arguments, and demanded time to be granted them, till their abbat, who was then absent, should return home, and give his consent to their agreeing to this demand, if he thought it expedient ; and they thereupon sent word to their abbat, explaining the particulars of the business to him. The abbat then sent word, by a feithful and prudent clerk of his, William de Bourg, to the king, and asked his advice in the matter, informing him of the perils which might arise from this matter ; and the king, seeing that a deed of this kind would be detrimental to that church, and in a like manner to others, as he was their patron, protector, and j/ governor --- and detesting the occult snares and avarice of the Roman court --- strictly forbade a breath of such an irregular proceeding any more to taint the air.

334 MATTHEW PABIS. \[a.D. 1241. St. Edmund becomes distinguished by miracles. About this time, the holy name and illustrious memory of the blessed Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, and the miracles of his sanctity, filled the coimtries on this side of the Alps with his glorious renown, so much so indeed, that, by / the extraordinary miracles which Grod deigned to work for him, the times of the apostles seemed to be renewed ; and archbishops, bishops, and nobles, with countless multitudes of people of both sexes, attracted, as it were, by the sweetsmelling odour of his perfumes, came from distant parts to his sepulchre at Fontigny, devoutly asking the assistance of the said Edmund. In England, too, at a nunnery at Catesby, where the said archbishop had left two of his sisters as nuns, to one of whom, as a token of affection, he had given his pall, God deigned to work so miraculously that the number of miracles there displayed would require especial and lengthened treatises to relate them. 7%e monks of Canterbury obtain absolution from the pope\^ and elect Bontface as their archbishop. About this time, in the month of April, the monks of Canterbury, who had been sent to Rome on behalf of the conventual assembly, to- obtain absolution from the sentence which the archbishop had denounced against them, returned from the Boman court, having obtained that they should receive absolution by way of caution, the abbat and archdeacon of St. Alban\'s, with the prior of Dunstable, being deputed to settle the matter. But their old persecutor, Master Simon Langton, archdeacon of Canterbury, immediately opposed the decree they had obtained, and appealed against it, boldly declaring that it was by false insinuations and by suppressing the truth that the letters of absolution had been basely obtained. The monks, however, who had faithfully promised to elect Boniface as their archbishop, as the king had most earnestly entreated them to do, laid a heavy complaint before the king, of the injury inflicted upon them by the said Simon, and his designing maUce against them. The king, then, espousing the cause of the monks, and being pleased with their promise of electing Boniface\^ told the said Archdeacon Simon, with dreadful threats, that

Simon, therefore, finding the king determined, and knowing the pope would not offend the king in anything, and also feeling himself too old to travel across the Alps, remained quiet, and gave up his purposed intention. The monks of Canterbury then, finding that the pope and the king indidged them by turns, and mutually assented to each other\'s requests, after invoking the grace of the Holy Spirit and the king\'s favour, elected as the pastor of their souls, Boniface, bishop elect of Basle, a man of tall stature and handsome figure, and an uncle of the lady Eleanor, the illustrious queen of England, yet entirely unknown to the aforesaid monks, a« regarded Ms laiowledge, morals, or a«e, and (as was stated) totally incompetent, compared with the , archbishops his piedecesiors, for%uch a dij\^ed station.\^ They however elected him, on this consideration, namely, that, if they had elected any one else, the king, who obtained the favour of the pope in everything, would invent some groimds of objections, and reject and anniJ the election. And in order that the pope might not reject the bishop elect as incompetent, or rather that he might appear competent and fit foHuch a high dignity, the lig, X endeavoured by all the means in his power to promote the cause and raise the fame of the said Boniface, now elected or about to be elected, ordered a paper to be drawn up, in which the person of the said Boniface was praised beyond measure, and in evidence of the truth of it appended his royal seal to the said writing. He then sent it to the bishops and abbats, enjoining or imperiously begging them to set their seals also to it\^ and to bear evidence to his assertion ; several, however, unwilling to violate the integrity of their conscience, and fearing to break the Lord\'s commandment, \*\*Thou shalt not bear false witness,\" firmly refused to obey him. Several of the clergy of the higher ranks, however, namely some bishops and abbats, were alarmed and enervated by the king\'s threats, and, laying aside their godly fear, and showing reverence to man more than to God, a£xed their seals to it, as a guarantee and testimony of their behef, and wiQingly accepted of this Boniface as their superior. Although he was of noble blood, and

The oppression of the count of Provence. About this time, Eaymond, count of Provence, father of the French and English queens, sent several special messengers to his son-in-law the king of France, with urgent entreaties that he would afford him effective assistance as a father-in-law and ally. For the count of Toulouse had by command of the emperor made war on him, and harassed him even to utter destruction, and he was now entirely destitute of the means of resistance, having exhausted the money sent to him by the king of England. The French king, on this, wrote in an amicable strain to the emperor, as well as to the count of Toulouse, begging of them, out of their respect and affection for him, to show mercy to his father-in-law. The king of England, also, and his brother Richard, earl of Cornwall, wrote letters to the same two parties to the same effect ; and by these means the count of Provence, after a long time, was allowed to enjoyed tranquillity. How the Venetians harassed the emperor. The Venetians during all this time obstinately persisted in doing the emperor all the injury in their power and by every means they could devise, both by sea and land, in revenge for the death of their chief, the podesta of Milan, whom, as has been before stated, the emperor had taken when fighting against him at Milan, and who after having been imprisoned was condemned, and put to death by the emperor\'s orders. The emperor\'s diligence in defending himself against his various enemies. About this time, the emperor Frederick took forcible possession of the noble city of Faenza\^ which he had so long besieged, and which was now unable to hold out any longer; the siege having lasted for nearly a year, and the emperor

Oh ! what anxiety, what manifold trouble afflicted the heart\'s blood of the emperor in defending his empire ! For he had six numerous and formidable armies : one, which he commanded in person ; another, a double army, in the (Genoese territories, namely, a naval force to oppose by sea the passage of the legates and prelates, who despised his counsel, and another force by land near the sea-coast, under the command of his son Henry, king of Gallury and Torres, which continually ravaged the crops and vineyards of the Genoese ; a third army, imder his son Conrad, heir to the kingdom of Jerusalem, who had collected under him an innimierable army fix)m the whole of Germany and the adjacent provinces under the imperial dominion, he had sent against the Tartars, his son Conrad being the commander-in-chief, but accompanied by the dukes of Austria, Saxony, and Bavaria, and other nobles, prelates, and others, too numerous to mention, and followed by an innumerable host of people, who had all with one accord voluntarily and eagerly assumed the cross, and were prepared to fight to the death against the said Tartars on behalf of the Church xmiversal ; a fourth army he had employed in the march of Treviso, commanded by Theobald, said to be a Frenchman bom, an especial ally of the emperor\'s ; a fifth was engaged in the march of Ancona and the valley of Spoleto ; and the sixth in the Holy Land, under Balph, his mareschal, to whom Earl Hichard had intrusted the charge of the Holy Land, which had been obtained possession of or tranquillized by him, and especially the castle of Ascalon, which he, the said Earl Bichard, had nobly strengthened at his own expense, to the strengthening and honour of Christianity in general The firmness qf the monks of Winchester \^ and the oppression exercised against them. About this tiihe, some satellites of the court, trusting in the king\'s orders, and habituated to making great things from trifles, going to Winchester, arrogantly demanded who the monks were that had refused to obey the king\'s commands in the matter of the election, or the demand for the election of the bishop of Winchester, which of them had so saucily, in disobedience to the king, made that demand, for William de B«le, bishop of Norwich, and would not conVOL.

About this time, the royal city of Faenza, which, as has been stated, had been invested and besieged by the emperor Frederick, was at length reduced, and surrendered to him at discretion ; the famished citizens, worn down with hunger and manifold distresses and troubles, came in crowds and lell at the emperor\'s feet, with sighs and tears begging for mercy, not judgment. And whilst all these people, who had so long been raising the imperial anger to its height, were in expectation of dying by the most refined tortures, as well on accoimt of their old offences, of which mention has been previously made, as because by the lengthened and expensive siege of their city the emperor had exhausted an immense sum of money, the victor, with generous clemency, spared them ; by doing which he gained the affections of many.

Alreadyhad they, with unheard-of tyranny, in a great measure reduced to a desert the countries of Frieslaiid, Gothland, Poland, Bohemia, and both divisions of Hungary, slaying or ptitting to flight princes, prelates, citizens, and rustics. This occurrence is evidently testified by the following letter, which was sent into these parts. A letter written to the duke of Brabant concerning the same people. \" H&n/ry, by the grace of God, cowrU of Lorraine, paJUuine of Saaxmy, to his toell-beloved ami alwoAfs to he beloved lord amd faJther-iinAaw ike iHustruyus dvke of Braha/nt, good-wUl in his service whenever he shall dema/nd it. --- \^The dangers foretold in the Scriptures in times of old, are now, owing to our sins\^ springing up and breaking out ; for a cruel and countless v/ horde of people, outlawed and wild, is now invading and raking possession of the territories adjoining ours, and has now, after roving through many other countries, and exterminating the inhabitants, exten(}ed their incursions as far as the Polish territory. Of these matters we have been fully informed, as well by our own messengers as by the letters of our beloved cousin the king of Bohemia, and have been called on to prepare ourselves with all haste to proceed to his assistance, and to the defence of the Christians. For we are truly and plainly informed by him that this said race of people, the Tartars, will, about the octaves of Easter, cruelly and impetuously invade the Bohemian territory, and if seasonable assistance be not given to the Bohemians, an unheard-of slaughter will take place. And as the house adjoining our own is already on fire, and as the neighbouring country is open to devastation, whilst some coimtries are even now being ravaged, we, on behalf of the Church universal, anxiously invoke and beg assistance and advice from God and oiur neighbouring brother princes. And as delay is pregnant with danger, we beg of you, with all possible diligence, to take arms and to hasten to our succour, as well for the sake of our freedom as for that of your own, and to use strenuous endeavours to prepare a powerful force, by arousing the z2

We are now, by the instrumentality of our prelates, and Preacher and Minorite brethren, causing a general crusade (for it is a matter connected with Christ) to be preached, prayer and fasting to be enjoined, and our territory in general to be roused to war for the sake of Jesus Christ. To this we may add, that a large horde of this detestable race of people, in conjunction with another army which is allied with them, is ravaging Hungary with unheardof cruelty, to such an extent that the king is said to retain only a very small portion for himself To sum up the matter in a few words, the Church and the people in the northern countries are so oppressed, and overwhelmed with so many and such great troubles and difficulties, that they have never suffered so severely from any scourge since the beginning of the world. Given in the year of grace 1241, on the day when is chanted, \* Let Jerusalem rejoice.\' \" Letters of similar purport were also sent by the duke of Brabant to the bishop of Paris ; and the archbishop of Cologne also wrote to the king of England to the like effect.

When that venerable and well-beloved servant of the Lord, Blanche, mother of the French king, was informed of this scourge of God\'s wrath, which was impending over the nations, she called her son to her, saying, \" King Louis, where are you, my son \] \" On which he approached her and said, \" What want you, mother?\" She then sighed deeply and burst into tears, but, although a woman, she pondered on these imminent perils not as a woman, and said to him, \"What, my dear son, is to be done concerning these lamentable events, a fiightftd report of which has flown to our territories? A general destruction of us all and of the holy Church is imminent in our time, owing to the impetuous iixcursions of the Tartars amongst us.\" The king.

The emperor then, on hearing of these things, wrote to the Christian princes, and especially to the king of England, as follows : --- The emperor\^s letter concerning the approach of the Tartars. \^\^Frederick, emperor, d;c,, to the Jdng of Ervglamd, greeting, --- We cannot be silent on a matter which concerns not only the Boman empire, whose office it is to propagate the Grospel, but also all the kingdoms of the world that practise Christian worship, and threatens general destruction to the whole of Christianity : we therefore hasten to bring it to your knowledge, although the true facts of the matter have but lately come to ours. Some time since a people of a barbarous race and mode of life called (from what place or origin I know not) Tartars, has lately emerged from the regions of the south, where it had long lain hid, burnt up by the sun of the torrid zone, and, thence marching towards the northern parts, took forcible possession of the coimtry there, and remaining for a time, multiplied like locusts, and has now come forth, not without the premeditated judgment of God, but not, I hope, reserved to these latter times for the ruin of the whole of Christianity. Their arrival was followed by a general slaughter, a universal desolation of kingdoms, and by utter ruin to the fertile territory, which this impious horde of people roved through, sparing neither sex, age, nor rank, whilst they confidently hope to destroy the rest of the human race, and are endeavouring to rule and lord it alone, trusting to their immense power and unlimited numbers.

The proximity of these barbarians, with some difficulty put the Kuthenians, who dwell near them, on their guard, so that, being imused to the attacks of this unknown people, they consulted their own safety, and, frightened lit their fiir\^ as at fire, they took precautions fo\^ guarding themselves against their attacks. The Tartars took to pillage and destruction. By the sudden attacks and assaults of that savage race, which descends like the anger of God, or like lightning, Kiew, the chief city of that kingdom, was attacked and taken, and the whole of that noble kingdom, which ought to have united itself with that of Hungary, for its defence and protection, but which it carelessly neglected to do, was, after its inhabitants were slain, reduced to a state of utter destruction and desolation. Their king, an idle and careless man, waa ordered by messengers and letters from these Tartars, if he wished to save his life and that of his subjects, by a surrender of himself and his kingdom, at once to anticipate their fsivour ; but he was not frightened or warned by this, and thus gave a proof to his people and to others, that he and his ought sooner to have provided for their own protection and defence against their incursions. But, whilst these elated or ignorant people, despising their enemies, were idly sleeping with the enemy in their immediate neighbourhood, and trusting to the natural strength of the place, the Tartars made their way into the kingdom like a whirlwind, and suddenly surrounded them on all \'sides. The HungariLis being thL surrounded before they expected an attack, and surprised when unprepared as it were, tried to defend their camp against them. When the two rival armies of the Tartars and Hungarians were distant aoout five miles from each other, the advanced portion of the Tartars suddenly rushed forwards at the dawn of the morning, and suddenly surrounding the camp of the Hungarians,

The king himself with difficulty escaped, mounted onaiieet horse, and fled, attended by a small retinue, to share the lot of his brother in the kingdom of Illyria, that he might at least be protected there. The victors, exulting in the spoil, then took up their quarters in the camp of the conquered Hungarians ; and at this very moment they are ravaffing the largest and finest part of Sungar,, beyoL the rivrBanube, l\^ra«sing the inhabitants with Are and sword, and threaten to involve the rest in the same destruction, as we have been informed by the venerable bishop of Vatzen, the said king of Hungary\'s ambassador to our court, afterwards sent to that of Kome, who, passing through our territory first, bore testimony to what he had seen ; and his evidence is but too true. We have also been fully informed of these events, by letters from our beloved son Conrad, king elect of the Komans, heir to the kingdom of Jerusalem, and king of Bohemia, and from the dukes of Austria and Bohemia, as also by the word of mouth of messengers, who have been practically made certain of the proximity of the enemy. And we have heard all this with great perturbation of mind. As we have been intormed, and as the rumour of their proceedines, (roins: in advance ol them, declares, their innumemble army is\^divided into three iU-omened portions, and, owing to the Lord\'s indulging them in their damnable plans, has proceeded thus divided. One of these has been sent through the Pructenian territory and entered Poland, where the prince and duke of that country have faUen victims to thefr exterminating pursuers, and afterwards the whole of that coimtry has been devastated by them. A second portion has entered the Bohemian territory, where it is brought to a stand, having been attacked by the king of that country, who has bravely met it with all the forces at his command ; and the third portion of it is overrunning Hungary, adjoining to the Austrian territories.

The men themselves are small and of short stature, as far as regards height, but compact, stout, and bulky, resolute, strong, and courageous, and ready at the nod of their leader to rush into any undertaking of difficulty ; they have large &ces, scowling looks, and utter horrible shouts, suited to their hearts : they wear raw hides of buUockrasses, and harses ; »Li for armoiu-, they are protected by pieces of iron stitched to them, which they have made use of till now.

The letter, too, was proved to contain falsehoods ; for it was stated in it, that this unknown race of Tartars had burst forth from the southern parts of the world, under the torrid zone, which plainly appears to be a falsehood ; for we have not heard that they passed through the southern or even the eastern countries. Besides, they suspected that the secret plans, untraceable proceedings, and numerous plottings of these Tartars, were full of the imperial suggestions ; for they conceal their mode of speech, and vary their accoutrements; and if any one of them Ls made a prisoner, by no means can information of their designs be extorted from the captive, by any torture, however severe, he may be put to.

The pope admonuhes the prelates to spurn the advice of the emperor y and to come to the council. At this time, owing to unfavourable events, the lord Bishop James of Prseneste, sometime legate in France ; the Lord Otto, cardinal deacon in ca/rcere Tullicmo, some time since legate in Denmark, afterwards in England ; \^d Gregory of Romagna, who was just now sent as legate to the Genoese, to absolve from their sins such as obeyed him, were all delayed at Genoa, looking out for a fleet for themselves. There were also with them a great many archbishops, bishops, and abbats, who, as they feared to set sail, owing to the threats of the emperor, frequently received consolatory letters and messages from the pope, at the same time being admonished to set sail, and proceed without hjl to the council, yea, more resolutely to despise the threats of secular power, and more readily to obey their spiritual father. For, in consideration of a large sum of money paid by these prelates, an agreement had been made between them and the Genoese, that they, the said Grenoese, should safely conduct them all, legates as well as prelates, and their retinues, free from loss and injury, to the Roman court, even although against the emperor\'s consent. \"Whilst they were holding a carefrd and lengthened discussion on these matters, and some were in. a state of uncertainty as to what it would be safest and wisest to do, the pope sent word to them, that he would, without fail, send such powerful and effective assistance to them, in the shape of a fleet to meet them by sea, when they went out of harbour, for their conduct and protection, that the power of their enemies would not be able to oppose them in any way, nay, not even the emperor himself, whom his holiness had consigned to perdition and to Satan, as one lying under manifold anathemas.

He therefore requested that they would take their journey through his territory, in order that they might be more fully instructed concerning the rights in which he placed his trust, and that they might not be imposed upon by &Ise statements, and begged of them not to set sail suddenly for the Roman court, without being certified on these points. He accordingly sent special ambassadors to them when they were prepared for sailing, and with modesty and humility informed them that they might pass through all the territories under his dominion peacefuUy and in all safety, provided that they would not travel by sea, or along the sea-coast, and bade them rest assured tlmt none of his subjects would annoy them on their journey. He also bade them, if they would not believe his imperial promises, to prepare a certain form of guarantee, and promised inviolably to abide by the said terms in all respects, according as they should draw them up. He also declared, that after he had thoroughly explained his cause to them by word of mouth, and informed them of all the particulars of it minutely, he would commit it in all good Mth and confidence to be judicially examined into and definitely settled by the coimcil, and promised to submit to the discreet decision of such and so many of the holy fathers.

The emperor orders the prelates to be captured. When this feet was made known to the emperor, he was annoyed to find that he was despised, and his warnings and entreaties alike rejected. He therefore sent to his son Henry, whom he was accustomed to call his natural son, and to whom he had committed the duty of guarding the sea and sea-coasts with a naval force, and ordered him to oppose the passage of the prelates, and, without fear, to seize them on their voyage, or else to drown or slay them.

For a most bloody battle took place near the banks of the river Delpheos, not far from the Danube, and after many had fallen on both sides, the hostile army, although almost innumerable, was repulsed ; but before it retreated, a circumstance occurred, which proceeded from the trickery of the Jews, who thought that these enemies of ours were a portion of their Jewish race, who had been shut up in the Caspian moimtains, and had therefore come to assist them, for the subversion of Christianity \> and this enormous wickedness we have thought proper to insert in this work.

We, however, desiring / to remove from amongst us these our inhuman public enemies, and to release you Christians from their impending tyrannical devastation, have prepared about thirty casks ftdl of deadly intoxicating wine, to be carried to them as soon as possible. The ChrStians therefore permitted these wicked Jews to make this wicked present to their wicked enemies. When, however, these said Jews had reached a distant part of Grermany, and were about to cross a certain bridge with their casks, the master of the bridge, according to custom, demanded payment of the toll for their passage : the Jews, however, replied insolently, refusing to satisfy his demands\^ saying that they were employed in this business for the advantage of the empire, indeed of all Christendom, having been sent to the Tartars, secretly to poison them with their wine. The keeper of the bridge, however, doubting the assertion of these Jews, bored a hole through one of the casks ; but no liquor flowed tlierefrom ; and becoming certain of their treachery, he took off the hoops of the cask, and, breaking it open, discovered that it was full of arms. At this sight he cried out, \" Oh, unheard-of treachery, why do we allow such people to live amongst us ?\" And at once he and others, whom his astonishment had collected round him, broke open all the other casks, which, as soon as they had done, they found them also filled with Cologne swords and daggers, without hilts, closely and compactly stowed away ; they then at once openly showed forth the hidden treachery and extraordinary deceit of the Jews, who chose rather to assist these open enemies of the world in general, who, they said, were very much in need of arms, than to aid the Christians, who allowed them to live amongst them and communicate with them in the way of traffic. They were therefore at once handed over to the executioners, to be either consigned to perpetual imprisonment, or to be slain witb their own swords.

And immediately, or at least two or three days after they had prevailed on many to assume the cross, they absolved them from their vow on condition that they should contribute a large amount of money for the assistance of the Holy Land, each as far as his means would permit ; and in order to render the English more ready and willing to accede to their demands, they declared that the money was to be sent to Earl Richard ; and moreover, they showed a letter of his, for better security. They also granted the same indulgence to old men and invalids, women, imbeciles, and children, who took the cross or purposed taking it, receiving money, however, from them beforehand for this indulgence, and showed letters testimonial from Earl Richard concerning this matter, which had been obtained from the Eoman court.

The wretched death of Earl Gilbert, marshal, \\ Whilst the mutability of time was thus sporting with and deluding the world with its variable occurrences, Earl Gilbert, marshal, had, with some other nobles, arranged a sort of tilting-match, called by some a \" venture,\" but which might rather be called a \" misadventure ;\" they tried their strength about a crossbow-shot from Hertford; where he by his skill in knightly tactics, gained for himself the praise of military science, and was declared by all, considering his small size of body, to have justly distinguished himself for his valour. This was what the said earl chiefly aimed at ; for he was, in the first place, destined to clerical orders, and was reported to be weak and unskilful in warlike exercises. He was, at this tournament, mounted on a noble horse, an Italian charger, to which he was not accustomed, accoutred in handsome armour, and surrounded by a dense body of soldiers, who soon afterwards, however, left him, and dispersed, intent on gain. Whilst the earl, then, was amusing himself by checking his horse at full speed, and anon goring his sides with his sharp spurs, to urge him to greater speed, and, as the case required, suddenly drew rein, both the reins suddenly broke off at the junction with the bit. By this accident the horse became unmanageable, and tossing up his head, struck his rider a violent blow on the breast. Some there were who unhesitatingly asserted that the bridle had been treacherously cut by some jealous person, in order that, being thus left at the mercy of his horse, he might be dashed to pieces and killed ; or, at least, that he might be taken by his adversaries at will. Moreover, he had dined, and was neai\'ly blinded by the heat, dust, and sweat, and his head was oppressed by the weight of his heavy helmet. His horse, too, could not be restrained by him, or any

He expired in the evening of the 27th of June, amidst the deep and loudly-expressed sorrow of those who beheld him, at a house of the monks of Hertford. When he was about to breathe his last, having just received the viaticum, he made a bequest to the church of the blessed Virgin at Hertford, for the redemption of his soul. His body waa afterwards opened, when bis liver was discovered to be black and broken, from the force of the blows he had received. His entrails were buried in the said church, before the altar of St. Mary, to whom he had committed his spirit when djdng. On the following day, his body --- preceded by his brother, and accompanied by the whole of his family --- was carried to London, to be biu:ied near his father. At this same tournament, also, was killed one of the earl\'s retinue, named Robert de Saye, and his bowels were biiried with those of the earL Many other knights and men-atarms were also wounded and seriously injured with maces, at this same tournament, because the jealousy of many of the parties concerned had converted the sport into a battle. The affairs of the cross and the interests of the Holy Land suffered great loss by the death of the said earl, for he had intended to set out for Jerusalem in the next month, without fail, having collected money from all in the country who had assumed the cross ; for permission to do which, he had paid two himdred marks to the pope ; following the prudent example of Earl Richard.

These two were Peter, sumamed Le Rouge, and Peter de Supino --- two indefatigable extortioners, who held a papal warrant, for exacting procurations, imposing interdicts, excommunicating, and extorting

From the time when kings and kingdoms turned aside from Jerusalem, owing to its being divided and held by iniquitous and unjust possessors, we have been consumed with no small grief, and cannot altogether be silent, but must loose our tongue in bitter complaint, as there is no pleasant matter to occupy it ; for the sword of compassion has pierced to our soul, so as not to be able to contain itself For some time past, indeed, in the Holy Land, discord has reigned instead of peace, schism instead of union, hatred instead of affection, and justice has been totally excluded. Of such seed there have been many planters in that land, and many have become collectors of the fruit springing from it ; but I hope they are now eradicated. And there is no one amongst all its beloved ones to console it. For twin brothers disagreeing in the bosom of their mother, whose business it was to defend her, becoming proud in their affluence, have nourished and fomented these hujnours at the roots, and caused the branches of it to spread far and wide. For an abundance of good things produces such an itching after mutual contention, that the reprimands of the father who presides over the see of Peter, are encountered with the utmost indifference, provided that the stronger party dazzle the world vrith their renown. To the pacification of these discordant parties we have applied no small portion of care ; but, as yet, the footsteps of peace leave no impression, inasmuch as the followers of discord do not acquiesce in the words of peace.

From this cause, and the great number of the Gallic cavalry, almost twice as numerous as the Saracens, utterly prostrated by evil habits, the enemies of the cross were so unexpectedly encouraged, that a small body of them thought little or nothing of numbers of us. Owing to this, on our first arrival here, the nobles who were thought likely to help us were taking their departure, and it appeared to be a serious and difficult matter to relieve the country ; yet, the Divine clemency, when it wills it, suffers injuries to be without their remedies, and sorrow to be without means of consolation. For when we were expecting, on our arrival here, in conjunction with the rest of the Christians, to the utmost of our power, as was incumbent on us, according to our vow, to revenge the insults offered to the cross on the enemies of that cross, by attacking their tenitory and afterwards occupying and restoring them to good condition, behold the king of Navarre, the then head and chief of the army, and the count of Brittany, although aware of our approach for fifteen days before we arrived at Acre, took their departure vdth an immense host. Before they left, however, in order that they might appear to have done something, they made a kind of truce with Nazir, the lord of Crach, by which it was agreed that he should give up all the prisoners taken at Gaza, whom he had in his custody or power, together with some lands contained in the conditions of the truce, as a security for which he gave his son and brothers as hostages, fixing on a term of forty days for fulfilling the terms of the truce. Before that period, however, had elapsed, the said king and count departed, paying no heed to the time agreed on, or to the teims of the truce. Within this said period, namely, on St. Dionysius\'s eve, we, as we have before informed you, arrived at Acre ; and by the general advice of all, we at once sent to the aforesaid Nazir, to ask him if he could observe towards us the truce he had made with the said king, and we received word in reply, that he would willingly do so if possible, owing to his resi)ect for the said king of Navarre, although he should gain

At the expiration of the term, however, we received another message from him, stating that he could on no account abide by the aforesaid agreement ; on hearing which, by the common consent of all, we betook ourselves to Joppa, to improve with all possible caution the condition of the Holy Land, which had deteriorated from the aforesaid causes. At this place a man of rank and power came to us on the part of the sultan of Babylon, and told us that his lord was willing to enter into a truce with us if we pleased. After hearing and perfectly understanding what was to be set forth to us by him, and having with all sincerity invoked the grace of God, we, by the advice of the duke of Burgundy, Count Walter de Brienne, the master of the Hospitallers, and other nobles, in fact, the chiei\' part of the army, agreed to the undermenticmed terms of truce, which, although at our first arrival appeared to be a difficult matter to accomplish, is yet a praiseworthy one, and productive of advantage to the Holy Land, since it is a source of delight and security to the poor people and to travellers, advantageous and agreeable to the middle classes of the inhabitants, and useful and honoiirable to the rich and to religious men. Nor did it appear to us, on looking at the melancholy condition of surrounding events, that we could then employ ourselves more advantageously than in releasing the wretched prisoners from captivity, as there was a deficiency of men and things (although we alone still had money about us), and profiting by the time of the truce to strengthen and fortify against the Saracens the cities and castles that had become ruinous. We have thought propef\\ to insert the names of the places and territories which were given up in accordance with the terms of the truce, although H\^ it may be tedious to you, lest perchance some evil interpreter I may ascribe our deeds by way of glory to others or perversely \\ and maliciously pervert their character. For some, although J bat few, refused to consent to the terms of the truce, which are as follows : --- The lands to be given up according to the terms of the truce with Earl Richard are these ; the mountainous district of Beyrout, with the lands and separate portions belonging to it ; the whole country of Seid, with its appurtenances ; the castles of Beaufort, Corene, and the New ,V\"

The city of Jerusalem has also been given up to the Christians, as also Bethlehem and all the land about Jerusalem, with all the villages, which are named in the conditions of the truce, namely, St. Lazarus of Bethany, Brihaida, Wissewurch, Derphat, Bethamus, Becheles, and Bethic, Anon, Kokabi, Bersamul, Bebrit, Kikai, Bethame, Bebe, Kipsa, Behit, Horeb, Athacana, Clepsta, Tolma, Argahoga, Bertapsa, Bethsaphace, Tablie, and Sorobooz, with all their appurte nances, and the lands which are named in the divisions of Jerusalem, and the dependencies on the road thereto, as is more fiilly contained and described in the great truce. All this territory, with the castles therein before named, the Christians are allowed to fortify during the truce if they wish ; the noble captives taken at Gaza are also to be restored, and all the prisoners taken in the war with the French are to be released on both sides. As soon as the aforesaid truce was arranged, we took our way to Ascalon, and that the time might not hang idly on our hands, by the advice of all the Clmstian chiefs we began to fortify a large castle. From that place we sent messengers to the sultan of Babylon, to induce him to swear to observe the said truce, if he would do so, and at the same time to send the aforesaid prisoners ; he, however, for what reason we know not, detained our messengers\^ without giving us any reply, from St. Andrew\'s

We, during all this time, remained at Ascalon, assiduously intent on building the aforesaid castle, which, by God\'s favour has, in a short time, progressed so fiar that at the time of despatching these presents, it is already adorned and entirely surroimded by a double wall with lofty towers and ramparts, with four square stones and carved marble columns, and everything which pertains to a castle, except a fosse round it, which will, God willing, be completed without fidl, within a month from Easter-day. And this was not done without good reason ; for as we could not be certain that the truce would be confirmed, we thought it best to employ our time in building and fortifying this castle ; so that if the truce should be broken by any casualty, we might have, in the march and in the very entrance of their territory, this place, which was formerly under their dominion, as a safe and strong place of refuge, if it were necessary for us to retreat there. And those who remained therein would have no occasion to fear the result of a siege; for although the besiegers could cut off all assistance and provisions from them by land, yet all necessaries could reach them by sea. In times of peace, too, we believed that this castle would not be without its advantages, since it is the key and safeguard, both by land and sea, of the kingdom of Jerusalem, but will be a source of destruction and ruin to Babylon and the southern parts of the country. On St. George\'s day, then, after peace had been sworn to be observed on both sides, and after the truce had been confirmed, we received, according to the terms of the truce, all the Christian captives whom we had been so long expecting. After duly completing all these matters, we took leave of the Holy Land in peace, and on the festival of the Finding of the Holy Cross we embarked at Acre to return home ; but owing to the feir wind failing us on the voyage, and being much fatigued, we landed at Trapani in Sicily, in the octaves of St. John the Baptist. At that place we heard of the capture and detention of some of our bishops, and of other lamentable sufferings of the Church ; wherefore, in order to restore peace as fgr as we were able, amongst those at variance, and to urge with all our power

Earl Richard having heard that the precious bones of the French nobles, who had, through God\'s anger, been conquered and so mercilessly slain at Gaza, as before mentioned, were lying unburied and exposed, for the beasts and birds had entirely consumed the flesh, he was overcome with sorrow, and, having procured some vehicles and horses, he hastened thither and caused all the bones of those martyrs to be carefully collected and carried to Ascalon, to be buried in the cemetery there ; he also provided the means of supporting a priest to perform daily masses for ever for the souls of the dead. When the French nobles were informed that the earl had, amongst his other axjts of charity and kindness, performed such a pious action, he deservedly gained immortal praise and thanks from them ; for he had redeemed alive and released from captivity thirty-three imprisoned nobles, five hundred knights and pilgrims of the middle rank, and a great many knights and retainers of the Templars and Hospitidlers, and had afterwards caused the bones of the dead to be honoui-ably buried. Earl R. lands at the port of TYapam, in Sicily. Having thus happily and nobly fulfilled his pilgrimage in the Holy Land, Earl Richard landed, uninjured and scatheless, in Sicily, at the port of Trapani (as is mentioned in his letter), at which place an illustrious seneschal of the emperor\'s was awaiting him, by the emperor\'s order, and by whom he was received with the greatest joy and honour. This seneschal, finding that the earl had no horses, supplied him, as well as those who came with him, with them, and also with some quiet mules ; he also informed him where he would find the emperor. The earl, accepting of the seneschal for a guide, then set out in all haste to join him, giving thanks to God, who had preserved him from the dangers of the deep, brought him to a port of safety, and had rewarded him by being conducted to the presence of the emperor.

By the emperor\'s order, too, several various kinds of games and musical instruments, which were procured for the empress\'s amusement, were produced for his inspection, and afforded him great enjo3rment and pleasure. Ajnongst other astonishing novelties, there was one which particularly excited his admiration and praise : two Saracen girls of handsome form, mounted upon four round balls placed upon the floor, namely, one of the two on two balls, and the other on the other two. They walked backwards and forwards, clapping their hands, moving at pleasure on these revolving globes, gesticulating with their arms, singing various tunes, and twisting their bodies according to the time, beating cymbals or castanets together with their hands, aud putting their bodies into various amusing postures, affording with the other jugglers an admirable spectacle to the lookers-on. After some days had passed in repose from their toils, the emperor sent Earl Bichard, in whose fidelity and prudence he confided, to the court of Kome (as has been briefly mentioned in the letter sent by the earl to England), in order to restore peace between the pope and him. The emperor also, in addition to the honours he had already conferred on the said earl, gave him a paper sealed with the imperial seal, binding himself to abide by his decision on whatever conditions peace should be re-established by him. On his arrival at Kome, he was received by the B\^maus with insults and contempt, and found the pope so inexorable and adverse to peace, that to no form of peace which the earl proposed would he agree ; and, vice versa, the pope insisted, at all events, that the emperor should absolutely and entirely submit to his will and pleasure, and abide by the commands of the Church, and that he should make oath to do so ; but to this request of his Earl Kichard would not agree ; and after seeing and hearing at that court many things which justly displeased him, . he went away without effecting anything. Thus he, who was \^ honoured everywhere else as a promoter of the public weal. \' and servant of the cross, was at E(nne\~exposecf to injunes \\juid insults.

He therefore issued royal letters, ordering all throughout England who owed him military service to assemble at Gloucester, in the beginning of autumn, equipped with horses and arms, to set out on an expedition which he had determined on. He next held a council at Shrewsbury, on the morrow of the feast of St. Peter \"ad vincula\^ and within a fortnight he raised his standard, and turned his arms against his nephew David, as he had discovered him to be a traitor and rebel in every respect, and as he refused to come at any time to a peaceable conference at his, the king\'s\^ summons, even under a promise of safe-conduct ; for in a stiflfnecked and obstinate way he replied that he would not, on any account, release his brother Griffin. The king then led his army, which was numerous and of great strength, in good order, towards Chester, as if about to make war immediately. David, however, feared to encounter his violence, both because the heat, which had continued intense for four months, had dried up all the lakes and marshy places of \"Wales, and because many of the Welsh nobles, especially the powerftil and prudent Griffin, the son of Madoch, who had become a great ally of the king\'s, loved Griffin more than him, David, and also because he was lying under an anathema, and feared lest he should become still worse off; he therefore sent word to the king that he would set Griffin at liberty, at the same time informing him with many reasonings, that if he did release him, he would excite renewed wars against him. David also imposed on the king the condition that he should receive him peaceably, on his binding himself by oath, and by giving hostages, and that he would not deprive him of his inheritance. This the king kindly conceded, and David thereupon released his brother Griffin, and sent him to the king, who, trusting to prudent advice, sent him, on his arrival, to London, under the protection and conduct of John of Lexington, to be there kept in the Tower, with some other nobles of Wales\^ the hostages of David and other Welsh princes. All these events occurred between the day of the Nativity of St. Mary and Michaelmas-day. Wales reduced to subjection to King Henry the Thirdt without a battle.

Henry thus, under God\'s &,vour, triumphed over \] his enemies, and subdued Wales without bloodshed, and with- ( y . out having to tempt the doubtful chances of war. Wales, / \^ \^ in this case, discovered that the words of our Lord, mentioned in the Gospel, were not without truth ; namely, that \"\' every kingdom divided against itself is brought to deso- . lation.\" \^ Discovery of tin in Oemumy, In this same year, a most pure kind of tin was first found in Germany, in more abundajit quantities than in England. This metal was said to have been never found before since the beginning of the wprld, in any place except in ComwalL The value of it was now, however, much diminished and deteriorated, owing to the large quantities sent by Germany into England. Disagreement between the bishop qf Lincoln and the dbbat of Westminster, About this time, a disagreement arose between Robert, bishop of Lincoln, and the abbat of Westminster, which was productive of great expense, and caused much harm to both parties, and daily increased. For the said bishop was endeavouring by all the means in his power to weaken the proper privileges of that abbat, by converting the church of Heswell to his own uses, and to take forcible possession of that church; and when the least opportunity offered, to take it from the monks and bestow it on another person, one Master Nicholas, whom he had inhumanly deprived of his benefices.

This church, on its becoming vacant, the said bishop \^ had previously given to a clerk, named Master Simon, of London, penitentiary of the bishop of Durham, who was, \' therefore, much vexed with the king ; he, therefore, sent word to him, by the archdeacon of Huntingdon and Leicester, whilst he was in Wales, and admonished him, out of gratitude to God for the unlooked-for victory granted to fim, at once to make amends for this enormous transgression, lest perchance God, in his anger, should convert his snules into tears. To this message the king replied : \" I reply with safety, because an appeal has been made ; and nothing ought to be altered whilst the appeal is pending : and I have attempted nothing except by the advice of those learned in the law, and supported by Apostolic authority.\" One of the archbishops then said : \" My lord kinff, our master, the bishop of Lin\^lii, holds a privilege granted to him b\^ the pope, by which he is exempted from providing for any one at the command of the Apostolic See, unless especial mention is made of that privilege ; but in this order of the pope\'s, which the said John has obtained, and by virtue of which he has forcibly thrust himself into this church, relying on your assistance, no mention is made of that privilege ; wherefore the bishop of Lincoln is not bound to reply to him in this case, especially with respect to the giving away of the church of Thame, which he had previously, and with justice, given to another. And supposing that he had no such privilege, it is absurd for any one to push himself into the possession of any church without consulting, not to say against the will of, the diocesan bishop, although relying on the papal authority ; inasmuch as the pope wishes all things to be done in due order. And what reason is there now for causing dispute or injury to either party? For, considering the merits of this said John, who is a circumspect and sufficiently learned man, his grace the bishop of Imicoln will, at your request and that of himself, be easily influenced to provide him with as good, if not a richer benefice, and the bestowal will be lawful and honourable on both sides ; and the bishop, with all humility and devotion, begs that it may not be

I gi\^e way patiently. \^God will sufficiently provide for me at his good pleasure, as long as you are alive.\" , The king then agreed to put off the matter ; and having completed all the necessary arrangements in Wales, he left there Walter the Glerman, and some other men of prudence and influence, to build castles, strengthen the weaker parts of the country, and to provide arms and soldiers for its defence, and went himself to London rejoicing ; to which place also the said bishop had gone, fully prepared to pronounce sentence of excomiimiication agaiist thTsaid John in particular, and all the disturbers of his church and dignity. When the circumstance became known to the said John, he went humbly to the king, and said : \" My lord the king, the bishop of Lincoln is very much irritated, and in order that I may not be the cause of any further disagreement arising, or scandal being spread abroad, I resign this church.\" The king, on hearing this, was in alarm, lest --- as the bishop, who was very unbecomingly violent, said --- \^he should go into exile (as he saw that he was fully prepared to do so), and lay his bishopric under an interdict ; he therefore mitigated the severe measures he had planned, and no longer supported John in his opposition, as he saw that he refused to act against the bidiop. On this account, then, the said John was deservedly rewarded and forthwith invested with a richer benefice, namely the church of Maidstone, as a gift from the king ; and in the same year, was enriched with the possession of the rich church of Hoveden. The bishop was thus pacified, and, at the king\'s request, preached in public, as one in whose breast were stored up the keys of knowledge, and commended this humility of both parties ; amongs\^ other things making a comparison between the rays of the! sun, which are straight, and the king\'s justice, which should7 be direct and regular.

Disagreement between the bishop of Lincoln and his chapter. There still, however, continued a most injurious and unbecoming controversy between the bishop of Lincoln and the chapter of Lincoln, and some of the canons, who were present at London, were so harassed and injured by the bishop, that they were obliged to show a paper, and to make known its contents in public, for fear lest their church should have to submit to some new oppression, on the pretext which I will now relate. The restoration qf the church and see of lAneoln, Whereas, before the conquest of England, the see of the bishopric, which is now at Lincok, was at Dorchester, and, owing to the faults of the then presiding bishop, that plaoe was anathematized by the pope, and the bishop was deposed, the traces of that great matter scarcely remained affc\^r a lapse of many years, and thus the see, as weU as the care of a \* bishop, was at an end for a length of time.

He then called together eight archbishops and sixteen bishops, and caused that church to be solemnly ordained, secular canons to be appointed to it, and their separate revenues and portions to be assigned to them, in order that they might, under a bishop and a dean, regularly and honourably perform their duties according to certain rules and forms, and that such an important ordination, which was strengthened by the authority of so many holy fathers, and also by letters from the Apostolic See, might continue inviolate for ever. And the ordination was so made that when a bishop was ordained and the canons installed in their possessions, they should thenceforth, with due order and solemnity, perform services to God and his most holy mother day and night ; and if any of those canons should deviate from the paths of their discipline, and when rebuked for the same, should not amend his ways, he should be visited and punished by the dean, but without fear of anything previous to the chapter, and an accusation being made against him thereat ; but if he should not correct himself one way or another, he should be deprived of his benefice for one year or two, according to the degree of his fault ; and if he should still continue rebellious, the bishop\*s assistance should be called in to use coercive measures ; if he should even then continue in an incorrigible state of obstinacy, and kick against his authority, he should be deprived of all his benefices, and more severely punished by the kinsf. These roles gi\^g satis&ction to aU parties, thej were ilduced to writing, and were confirmed by the Apostolic See, and inscribed ; the church was then dedicated, and all who were present solemnly excommunicated all who should violate these orders. Therefore the canons say that, as the dean is neither negligent or ignorant, nor iicomi\^tent to visit delinquents, the bishop conducts himself unjustly and shamelessly in exacting visitations, and does not appear to be entirely free from the sting of the sentence so solemnly issued by such a number of the holy fathers. The king, on hearing this, claimed to be a party in this matter, and consequently the party of the bishop and chapter was greatly weakened ; and owing to such obstacles and impediments, the matter

The king of England causes a golden shrine to be made for the bones of St. Edward, In this year king Henry the Third, at his own expense, caused a shrine of the purest gold and costly jewels to be y elaborately constructed at London by picked workmen, for \[/ the relics of St. Edward to be placed therein. In the construction of this, however, although the materials were most costly, yet, according to the words of the poet, Materiam superabat opus. \[The workmanship did far indeed The rade material exceed.\] How the king reused to give up W, Marshals inherttanee to him. The king, at this time, showed himself ill-disposed towards \"Walter Marshal, brother of Gilbert, who had died without leaving any children, withholding from him the inheritance which belonged to him by hereditary right. \" For,\" said the king angrily to him, \" your father William is tainted with treachery, for he is said to have saved Louis from being taken when in England ; your brother Kichard was taken prisoner and slain in arms against me as an open and deadly enemy ; and your brother Gilbert, lately deceased, to whom, at tiie instance of Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, I granted his inheritance, more as a &.vour than as his right, ucluckilj instituted a tournament at Hertford, in Spite of my prohibition, at which he met with a miserable death.

Far be it from you, as a just prince, to make me alone atone for the faults of all ; far be it from you, my lord, to cause me to be the first punished out of such a great number.\" Notwithstanding this, the king\'s anger still continued, on which Walter kept silent, as he saw that he had lost the king\'s fiivour, according to the advice of the poet, --- Qaum faror in cursu est current! cede farori\* \[When rage whirls on in rapid coarse, Yield to the farioas torrent\'s force.\] and thus took his departure, as it were, in despair. Walter is created marshal by the king. About this same time there came to London the bishop of Durham, who had been long a most intimate friend of the king\'s, as being guardian of the royal body, and physician and guardian of the queen, and a proper monitor on the score of morals. He, at the request of the aforesaid Walter, in conjunction with some other nobles, and the queen herself, and all whom he knew to be most in the king\'s favour, by c \> gentle arguments and reiterated prudent entreaties, succeeded \\)\\\^ in softening the king\'s anger, and reconciled him to Walter, v \^ x-\^ The king being thus pacified, on the Sunday before the feast y\^\' of All Saints invested the said Walter with the earldom and \' marshal\'s office, retaining only in his own hands two castles of Cardiff and Cardigan, in Wales, which the king had formerly intrusted to the charge of Earl William Marshal, and afterwards of Hubert, the justiciary : for he considered it necessary to retain them, in order to strengthen the weaker parts of Wales, which he had lately obtained possession of, and to fortify them with castles and garrisons. The king enraged against the bishop of Norvnch. During all this time the king\'s anger had increased against the bishop of Norwich, because that prelate had consented to his nomination to the see of Winchester, for he would not, nor did it become him, to renoimce his right, although the king demanded of him a written agreement to give up his

Great dissension then occarionaUy occurred in his bishopric, occasioned by a writer of the court, who was at length, for his rash i usurpation, wounded, and suffered many other injuries. In consequence of this, many clerks as well as la3rmen were impiously beaten and injured, and suffered mudi harm at the hands of the secular authorities ; and the king declared on his oath that he would never desist from such oppression until the said bishop signed a paper, stating that he would never allow himself to be transferred to the see of Winchester ; but this was dissonant to reason, and contrary to the episcopal profession; for if his holiness the pope ordered him, by virtue of his obedience, to do so, he could not, on any account\^ as being a son of obedience, gainsay him. The persecution of the monks of Winchester, About this same time, that Briton, whom the king had by force placed at the head of the convent at Winchester, as prior, commenced annoying the conventual assembly in \^ various ways. For by the instrumentality of this same impostor, dissensions were excited, in order that there might appear good reason for the monks who opposed him to be excommunicated. After a lapse of forty days, he summoned some of the king\'s agents, and said to them, \'\' Go and avenge the insult offered to the king and to us on these rebels against us, for they are excommunicated, and it will be no offence if you lay violent hands upon them.\" The king\'s attendants rushed forth in troops, violently laid their profime hands on the monks, who fled to the great altar to seek protection there, and, urging and dragging them along with such force, that they stained the pavement with blood, they ejected them from the church ; an

T\\co of the pope\* 8 agents extort money from England, Scotland, and Ireland, Peter de Supino, a clerk of the pope\'s, had all this time been most assiduously collecting money, by extorting the twentieth part of property firom all Ireland, supported by a warrant from the pope, and carried away from tiat country a sum of fifteen hundred marks, besides divers gifts. Master Peter Le Eouge, too, who styled himself a familiar and relation of the pope, was also protected by a papal warrant, and diligently employed himself in amassing fresh heaps of money from the northern parts of England, and by sending messengers throughout Scotland. At length, with their saddle-bags well filled, they proceeded under conduct of the monks of Canterbury to Dover, and suddenly and secretly set sail ; for they had heard from messengers, sent in all haste, that the pope was still without hopes of recovery ; indeed, that he was either now dead or would die almost immediately. They therefore took to a sudden and clandestine flight, both by land and sea, with their booty, because they were afraid that, if the king should gain intelligence of the pope\'s death, he would prudently retain all the money they had collected, and consider how to proceed with it on the succession of another pope. Scarcely had they entered France, when, lo ! Master Walter de Ocra, a messenger of the emperor\'s, arrived in all haste, though now too late, bringing letters of credence from the emperor and also a message to the king, informing him of the state of af\^drs at the Koman court, and advising him, if any such people were to be found in England, to detain the booty as well as the robbers. But when the messenger learnt that the two had escaped, he blamed the king\'s indolence, and immediately departed in sorrow and anger at having had his journey in vain : he, however, di%ently followed their steps, carefully watching the meanderings of those foxes, in order to tell the emperor the\' result of his journey.

382 MATTHEW PARIS. \[a.D. 1241. How the money collected by the pope\'s agents was consigned to the imperial treasury. The said agents of the pope being now informed of his death, although the thing was concealed from the people for some days, and knowing that the said Walter was following them on foot, hastened their journey, not sparing their horses. After crossing the Alps, they secretly betook themselves to the cities and houses of their relatives, stowing away the money with which they had come loaded, in secret places, and not making their presence known to all ; and as the said \"Walter could not find either them or the money, except only by slight whispering reports, he sent word to the emperor of everything, as well as of the fruitlessness of his search. His imperial majesty then ordered a strict search to be instituted throughout the whole of the cities of Italy subject to his rule, to discover who these papal messengers and traffickers were, who had, to the subversion of the empire and the common weal, and to excite war, fraudulently collected money throughout various countries, especially England, to bestow it on the pope, and thus to exalt his pride and give him an itching to disturb the peace of the empire. He then ordered them to be seized and imprisoned m deadly enemies, to be convened to appear, and their property and houses to be confiscated, as well as those of all their relations. Thus, after imr prisoning the principal of these men, with their wives \\ and children, he ordered a strict inquiry to be made as / to the s\\mi of money collected for the use of the pope, which I account he ordered to be committed to writing, and placed in the hands of the merchants of the cities and those who understood the business, and sC\^\^ribiitiQjv of it all to be made.

At the time of his decease he was almost a hundred years old, whilst his enemy the emperor was believed at thi\^ time to have been not more than fifty years, he having been reported to have been bom in the year in which Richard, king oi England, was made prisoner in Germany. The cause of his death being accelerated. The principal grief with which the heart of the pope was pierced, and which brought him to the point of death, was that the emperor, just after the feast of the Assumption, had taken a castle near Montfort, in Campagna, belonging to his, the pope\'s, nephews, and other relatives, and which he had newly built with the money of the crusaders, for the pro- \*/ tection of his relatives ; for Pope Gregory was well aware that the emperor hated all his relations ; and he wished, if the emperor should happen to invade Campagna, to prevent the necessity of their being exposed to his attacks. The emperor, however, having been informed of this circumstance, suddenly besieged this castle, destroyed it, and hung all whom he found therein ; and in token of the destruction of it, he left a sort of tower half-destroyed, that the memory of the ofience, as weU as of his revenge, might never die. Besides this, the pope was afflicted with the gravel, and very old, and was deprived of the use of his baths, with which he used to strengthen himself at Yiterbo.

At the time of Pope Gregory\'s death, mentioned above, there were ten cardinals present at the Roman court, two being still kept in prison by the emperor. These ten, after some deliberation, as was the custom, about electing a firesh pope, could not come to a satisfactory determination, because their number was broken up ; they therefore sent to the emperor, humbly begging him to send the brothers, the twp cardinals, to the court, on whatever terms he chose to impose, in order that the promotion of the welfiare of the Church, which chiefly depended on their electing a pope, might not be impeded by him. This the emperor kindly granted, being softened by the entreaties of \'\^dx\\ Bichard, on condition, however, that, imless Otto were elected pope, they should return to their former state and condition in prison. When, therefore, they were all assembled in the palace, called \" the Palace of the Sun,\" and five of the cardinals elected a sixth, who was Geoffrey of Milan, and this election was favoured by the emperor, who congratulated him on it, the three remaining ones elected a fourth, namely Bomanus ; but this election the emperor opposed, as he considered him a man of disreputable character ; both on account of his persecution of the university of Paris, and because he was said at one time to have debauched Blanche, the queen of France ; and. also because he was accused of having kept warm the discord between the lately deceased Pope Gregory and him, the emperor. The names of those who elected the first were Giles A span, Stephen Fitzconte, bishop of Portua, Beyner of Viterbo, John de Colonna, and Bobert Simimercote, an Englishman. Those who chose the other were Bichard Hannibal, the bishop of Ostia\^ who, according to custom, had the first voice in the election of a pope, and Sinibald, bishop of Sabina. A serious division was thus created between the brethren, on account of these elections ; for he ought to be elected pope in whose election two parts of the electors have consented, in accordance with the decree of Alexander, beginning with the words, --- \" However, to avoid discord, \^c.\*\* And thus this matter, so deeply concerning the

The emperor ordered a prudent and influential agent to be provided for Earl Eichard, to supply him with all necessaries, and to attend him civilly to the boundaries of the empire ; in consequence of which, as he passed through the cities and states of Italy, and others subject to the imperial rule, he was received with the greatest joy and honour.

When the prior and monks of Coventry heard of this event, they summoned the canons of Lichfield, and elected a monk of the church of Coventry, their precentor, as their bishop and pastor of their souls, although some of the canons opposed his election, and chose Eichard, abbat of Evesham, who was then the king\'s seal-bearer, and performed the duties of chancellor, and on whose behalf the king interceded with them.

But scarcely had he filled the papal chair for sixteen days, when he was cut off by a premature death, and paid the debt of nature, having been poisoned, as was stated, and thus again left the papal see, and indeed the whole Church, in a state of desolation. About the same time, too, one of the cardinals\^ named Bichard Hannibal, died. Conference of the bishops qf England. About this time the archbishop of York, the bishops of Lincohi, Norwich, and Carlisle, with many other influential and discreet religious men and ecclesiastics, met together to deliberate on the manifold desolations of the Church, and to ask for divine consolation. They then ordered special prayers to be made and fastings to be observed in general throughout England, that the Lord might be prevailed upon to relieve and restore the Roman church, which was now destitute of a pastor and of papal rule, thus taking example &om the Acts of the Apostles, wherein it is said, when Peter was i/ imprisoned, the Church prayed for him without intermission. They also came to the unanimous resolution to send messengers to the emperor to urge him, with moumfiil entreaties, as he regarded his soul\'s salvation, with sincere heart to dismiss all feelings of rancour and indignation, to abandon all kinds of tyranny, and not to obstruct the advancement of the Church\'s welfare, but rather compassionately to allow it to breathe freely, and, although provoked, to study to promote its advancement. For, they said, those who had pro-\^ voked him to anger were now dead, and it appeared an act of tyranny, and contrary to reason, to make the innocent pay for the faults of the guilty.

But when the King of kings, and Lord of lords, who rules over the power of tribunals, and whose will no one can resist, took her away from the unity of our body, aud from the bonds of fi«,temity by which you are imited to her, He, by a disposition, or rather dispensation of His counsels on high, provided that she should live to us and to you in the memory of her two children. For, by the giffc of Almighty God, a royal offspring lives, from whom a king and queen rise together, imder the eyes of their Neither, to stand in their mother\'s place. By her fruitfulness we have received noble pledges, which strengthen our common ties of affinity, and bind in a closer bond the seat of Caesar and that of your majesty, by a special prerogative of filial blood and nephewship, so that my love for you, based on the posterity of her, by whom it began, rises to the obligations and character of an alliance that long shall last. Although, therefore, the loss of our august spouse, your sister, cannot be mentioned by me or heard of by you, without great sorrow of heart, and affiiction at her death cannot be separated from our inmost heart, yet the memory of the beloved parent flourishes in the double offspring, and our connection ia indissolubly confirmed by those same nephews whom your august sister bore to me as children.

Peter of Savoy makes preparations to return home. Anno Domini 1242, which was the twenty-sixth of the reign of King Henry the Third, he held his court as usual at London, at Christmas, in a state of peace, and prolonged the festivities at the monastery for nearly fifteen days, during which time, namely on the day of our Lord\'s Circumcision, reports of the arrival of Earl Kichard in England spread abroad. On this, Peter of Savoy, earl of Richmond, prudently, and like a discreet and circumspect man, resigned into the king\'s hands the distinguished and noble castles of the kingdom of which he had received the charge ; for he was afraid that his sudden elevation would much displease the nobles of England, and that he had imdertaken a burden beyond his strength in taking on himself the charge of these castles, while the English were despised and suspected. And in order that no disturbances might arise in England through him on the arrival of the Earl Richard, who would, perhaps, hear serious complaints on this matter, after wisely weighing in his mind the imminent peril to himself, he resigned them altogether, and made arrangements, after obtaining the king\'s permission, to return home ; and by this act of prudent moderation he pacified the feelings of many. But with the same fecUity as permission to depart had beea given him, he was, before he had taken ship, recalled in haste by the king, at whose importunate request he again, although unwillingly, received charge of the castle of Dover. The insolence of the covnt de la Marche, In this year, the count de la Marche, the most powerful of all the Poictevin nobles, refused to do homage and make his allegiance to Amphulse, the brother of the French king, who had, by the gift of his said brother the king, unjustly usurped possession of the county of Poictou, and began to kick against that noble\'s authority and to repent of his purpose. Some time after, the said count de la Marche was invited to come peaceably to breakfast with the said Amphulse, count of Poictou, during the festivities of Christmas ; but one night, about four days from Christmas, being about to do so\^

A complaint made to the French king of this proceeding, Amphulse then laid a heavy complaint before the king, concerning this transgression, both of this unbecoming flighty and of the burning of his house by the said count, who like a mouse in a sack of wheat, or a snake in a man\'s bosom, thus ill remunerated his hosts.

When, therefore, the king made known to them the irrevocable determination of his heart, namely, to cross to the continent in accordance with the summons of the count de la Marche, and with various arguments demanded pecuniary assistance from them, the nobles replied with great bitterness of spirit, that he had conceived this design without consulting them ; that he was void of shame, to make such a demand; that he had so frequently harassed and impoverished his &ithM subjects, demanding money from them as a matter of course, as if they were the basest slaves ; and had so often extorted large sums of money from them, which was expended with no advantage ; they therefore now apposed him to his fece, and refused any more to be despoiled of their \^onej to no purpose.

And if by chance the French king should have entered upon any enterprise contrary to the terms of the truce, that then the said king of England should send special messengers to him, to induce him, by request and admonition, to observe the truce and to think better of his enterprises, if any shoold have been mide by him or his nobles. And if the Frendi king shoidd refuse so to do, that they woidd then willingly join themselves to his counsel, for the purpose of giving him assistance as &r as was in their power.\" All unanimously agreed in this answer.

Besides this, he then promised them that all the liberties contained in th(great charte7)Bhould from that time, as formerly, be ftdly observed throughout the whole of his kingdom ; and of this he gave them a small charter, in which the same things were contained ; and this they now hold. Besides this, the king, of his own fr\'ee will, and by the advice of his barons, promised them that the whole of the money arising from the said thirtieth part, should be placed in safe custody in his royal castles, under the charge of four nobles of England, namely. Earl Warrenne, and others, at whose discretion, and by whose advice, the same should be expended, when necessary, to the advantage of the said king and kingdom. And inasmuch as the barons do not know, and have not heard, that any of the aforesaid money has been expended, at the discretion or by the advice of any one of the said four nobles, they firmly believe, and, in feet, well know, that the king still has the whole of that money untouched ; and from that he can now provide himself with great assistance. Besides this, they well know that, since that time he has had so many escheats, namely, the archbishopric ot Canterbury, and several of the richer bishoprics of England, and the lands of earls, barons, and knights deceasec\^ who held ot him : that from those escheats alone, if they were only well taken care of, he ought to have a large sum of mor\*»v Moreover, from the time of their giving the &dd thirtieth part, itinerary justiciaries had been continually going the circuit, through all parts of England, collecting pleas of the forest, and all other pleas ; so that all the counties, hundreds, cities, boroughs, and nearly all the villages even of England, were heavily fined ; hence, from this circuiting alone the king has, or ought to have, a very large sum of money, if it were paid, and properly collected.

But inasmuch as he was their lord, he may behave himself in such a manner towards them, up to the end of the aforesaid truce, that they will then give him as good advice as they are able. When the said nobles, who had acted as messengers, had told this reply to the king, they returned to the barons and said that they had in part given the proper reply to the king ; but he wanted to know what they would do if the king of France should break the truce before the expiration of the term ; they also promised in the name of the king that, if he had done any injury to any of the nobles of England, he would make amends for it, according to the arbitration of Peter of Savoy, and others of his counciL To these questions the nobles replied, that, if the king of France should break the truce, they would then apply themselves to devising plans, as they had previously said that they would do, at the expiration of the truce ; provided, however, that they were assured of the truth of the French king\'s having done so. To the charge that they, on the part of the king, promised amends for the injuries inflicted on them, the messengers said that they would not at present wrangle with the king. At the time of the grant of the thirtieth part, W. de Rele had, on the part of the king, promised them well and faithfully, as they now did, and how the king kept his promises, he himself best knew.

This archbishop. had conspired with the other prelates, who had come to the general council, to effect the downfell of the emperor j and having heard of the fate of those who had gone through the imperial territory, he changed his course, and returned by by-roads; but as ambuscades were laid in all directions, he was taken, and detained a prisoner. The person who took him, however, being a German, and well known to the pontiff, allowed his prisoner to escape, after faithfully promising, on oath, never again to plot against, or to injure the emperor. TheV.\^ archbishop, however, ill kept his oath, as will be related in / the following history. \^ The king of France equips a fleet against the English. The rumour of these events soon flew through the various parts of the world, and the French king being informed of the approach of the king of England in a hostile manner against him, and of the conspiracy of those who had summoned him to assist them, stationed eighty well-armed galleys before Rochelle to guard these parts of Poictou against any who endeavoured to enter them. He also caused a military force, such as Finance usually pours forth, to be called together by his royal warrant throughout the various provinces subject to him, and the bands of civil communities to arouse themselves at his royal summons. How the king qf England collected a great deal of money. The king of England, in the mean time, frequently received the most urgent messages from the count de la Marche and the other nobles of Poictou, and became unalterably fixed in his determination, believing that he should, without fail, receive all that the count had promised him ; and, as they had advised him to do, he collected a large sum of money. Those who refused him pecuniary assistance, he either con\"\^ . sidered as his declared enemies or harassed them in every 1 -\^ possible way by his satellites.

The king, craftily endeavouring to incline the hearts of those who were wavering to his wishes, by means of costly presents weakened the firmness of many of the nobles. He even, by enticing promises gained over his brother Earl Richard to accompany him on his expedition, imder the hope of an abundant reward, and he effected this the more easily because the French king, with rash presumption, had a short time before, as above stated, bestowed the county of Poictou on Amphulse, his own brother, and had thus imjustly deprived him, Earl Eichard, of his possessions; and the Poictevins had promised to a certainty to restore them all to him on his arrival there. Ambassadors sent in advance to notify the king\^s approach. The king\'s special coimcillors, Peter of Savoy, earl of Bichmond,and Peter d\'Aigueblanche, bishop of Hereford, were now sent to the continent to comfort the king\'s friends in Poictou by the news of his being about to arrive there immediately. By this their hopes were raised, and they at once began the war, fiercely demanding the restitution of his rights on behalf of the king of England, and did no small injury to the French monarch. After delivering the king\'s message, Peter of Savoy, narrowly escaping an ambuscade laid for him, returned to the king at London a little before Easter, sound in body, but not without loss. Peter, bishop of Hereford, took an out-of-the-way road home, in order to arrive in safety, and thus avoided the snares of those who sought his life ; on his way he went to Provence, and demanded from the count of Provence, fether of the Fi:ench and English queens, his third daughter, Cincia, in marriage for Earl Richard. At this the whole community in England were much excited, and began to fear that the whole business of the kingdom would be disposed of at the will of the queen and her sister, the said Cincia, about to become the wife of Earl Richard, who would be, as it were, a second queen.

The French king, in the mean time, having heard that the king of England had landed to make war on him, relying on assistance from the Poictevins and the promises of the Gascons, and knowing that the coimt de la Marche had already commenced the war, summoned by royal prodamation all the military force of France, and ordered the train bands to be supplied with anns and provisions, in order that, when occasion required them to be called out, he might find them ready. He also had about a thousand carts gut ready to carry the tents, engines, provisions, arms, and other necessaries, and then arranging his troops, which were the best France coidd produce, in good order, he set out on his march towards Poictou, to repel by force the hostile incursions of the king of England and his other enemies. There were about four thousand knights splendidly armed to the teeth, besides numbers of others, who came from all directions i/ and flocked to the army like rivers flowing\~info TEe s\^; and the nimiber of retainers and crossbowmen was aedd to amount to about twenty thousand. 7%e capture of Willimm Mmrsk, mnd Mb ptmitkmeni ei Lomdom, Near about this time, the knight William Marsh, of whom mention was made above, after spending some time at the before-mentioned island, indulging in rapine and plunder, was surprised by some of the king\'s agent\^ made prisoner, and carried to London, where he was closely imprisoned in the Tower. On the feast of St. James, by the king\'s order, the said William, with sixteen of his accomplices taken with him, was tried and condemned, and, by the king\^s order, was sentenced to an ignominious death. He was, therefore, first dragged frt)m Westminster to the Tower of London, and from thence to that instrument of punishment called agibbet\^ suspended on which he breathed forth his miserable life. After he had grown stiff in death, his body was let down and disembowelled ; his entrails were immediately bmnt on

His sixteen accomplices were all dragged through London at the horse\'s tail, and hung on gibbets. The said William, after his condemnation, when about to imdergo the sentence pronounced upon him, invoking the divine judgment to witness, boldly declared that he was entirely free and guiltless of the crime of treason imputed to him, and likewise of the murder of the aforesaid clerk Clement ; he also asserted that he had betaken himself to the aforesaid island for no other reason than to avoid the king\'s anger, which he had always above all things wished to pacify by submitting to any kind of trial, or by any other humiliation ; but that, after he had taken refiige as a ftigitive in the said island, he was obliged to prolong his miserable life by seizing on provisions wherever he could find them. He then poured out his soul in confession before God, to J. de St. Giles, one of the brethren of the Preacher order, and confessed his sins with contrition, not excusing himself and giving vent to evil words, but rather accusing himself. This discreet preacher and confessor then administered gentle comfort to him, and dismissed him in peace, persuading him that he underwent the death to which he was doomed by way of repentance. And thus, as before mentioned, horrible to relate, he endured not one, but several dreadful deaths. 7%e victory of the Templars m the Holy Land, In this year the Templars in the Holy Land, more by a miracle than by human strength, gained a glorious and unexpected victory over many thousands of the Saracens who had come from the parts near Babylon. The Poictevins and Gascons fortify themselves against the French, In the height of the summer, when the heat of the sun had so dried up everything that it almost faded away, the Gascons and Poictevins, in great fear of the attack of the French, who were now hastily marching on them, fortified their castles and cities, and blocked up the passes of the mountains through which the enemy could enter their country to injure them, with large blocks of stone, and the trunks of felled trees, and rendered the roads and paths im 

About the same time, as the laborious season of autumn drew on, the French king, in a very unbecoming manner, gave orders to seize the bodies of English merchants who were trafficking with their wares throughout his kingdom ; thus inflicting an enormous injury on the ancient dignity of Granl, which formerly aflbrded a safe asylum and protection to all exiles and proscribed men, especiaUy the peaceable ones; from which circumstance it originally obtained the name of France in its own language. This dishonourable and cruel proceeding soon reached the ears as well as the feelings of the king of England, on which he also gave orders that the French traders found in any part of England should undergo a just retaliation ; he also at the same time sent to the guardians of his kingdom, namely the archbishop of York and his colleagues, demanding a supply of money and reinforcements of troops. They accordingly, in obedience to the king\'s orders, sent off without delay fifty crofisbowmen, a large sum of money, a good supply of provisions, and some soldiers with arms, under conduct of the Cinque Ports ; on seeing which, some of the English nobles, thinking it di» 

The «u1o!b and pirates, who kept a diligent guard over the opposite coast of France, on finding this out, by order of the French king, prepared a naval force, and, arming themselves, put to sea with sails set on their \^ips, and their galleys manned with numerous rowers, to attack the approaching force at sea, or to frighten them into a retreat to their own shores. When, however, the two fleets drew near together, a sudden tempest arose, and they were so dispersed, some in one direction, some in another, that the commanders of the ships, consulting their own safety, were carried at the mercy of the winds, and at length scarcely knew their companions, or the ships of their own fleets apart. The French, who were nearer to their own coast thaii the English or Irish to theirs, made their way with all speed to the nearest part of the coast, and as the wind was not much against them, arrived at a safe place of refuge, some even reaching their proper ports ; whilst our people, fearing in no slight degree the fary of the winds as well as of the French, dispersed themselves in flight, and, hurried on by fear, shame, and sadness of heart, were driven ashore on various remote and unknown parts of the coast Owing to this misfortime, the abbat of Evesham, Bichard de Burg, and many others, who were in command of the expedition, never after recovered a sound state of health, but gradually pined away, until at length, being im\* able to regain their strength after so much suflering and toil in a foreign land and a strange climate, they breathed forth their afflicted lives. By this sad misfortune the king in-\* curred a great and irreparable loss of powerful and prudent men, arms, and provisions, namely com, which he had collected from the archbishopric of Canterbury, and from other bishoprics, and also of money scraped together from all quarters.

This lady had also gained great renown, because she had on one night, at Woodstock, whilst passing the night in singing hymns, watching, and prayer, saved the king from the hands of the murderer, by her . outcries, the particulars of which event have been befono V stated Tke mUrageoMM crime of Waiter B\'seit. About the same tjme\^ wtoumamentSvwere unfortunately being held in the northern provinces, at one of which, held on the borders of England and Scotland, one Walter Bisett, a brave, though crafty knight, was worsted by his antagonist--- one Patrick Iitz-Thomas, of Galway ; whereupon he conceived an unheard-of crime, in order to take unjust vengeance on his conqueror. Whilst the said Patrick was staying with some other nobles in his company at Edmonton, he took up his quarters for the night in a land of bam ; and whilst sleeping in a state of calm sleep, the said Walter Bisett, after blocking up the door outside with some trunks of trees, inserted fire in several places in the walls\^ by means of some lighted sticks, and burned nearly all who were inside.

The king, with some difficulty, appeased their rage and cahned their vengeance, by promising that the said Walter should be disinherited, should abjure Scotland, and be sent into perpetual exile ; they, therefore, after some difficulty, agreed to the king\'s proposal, trusting to entrap him when removed from the king\'s protection, and to punish EmTy a Just death. The design, however, coming to the king\'s knowledge, --- who was a just and merciful man, --- \^he carefully concealed the said Walter for three months in places where his enemies could not get at him ; at the expiration of which time he secretly fled frx)m the country, one dark night, a judicially proscribed and disinherited man, never again to return ; the Scotch nobles, who were a great many of them seeking his life, being in utter ignorance of his escape. Walter, however, although he had sworn to proceed to the Holy Land, and never to return, for the redemption of his own soul, as well as those who perished by burning, though, as he said, it was not through his means, changed his course, and hastened to lay a complaint before the king of England, of the great injury done him ; he there declared that the king of Scotland had unjustly deprived him of his inheritance, as he could not in any other way calm the anger of those who were rising against him in their fiiry ; although he, the said Walter, was ready and willing to clear himself, and prove his innocence of the crime imputed to him, by the (Ord\^ oTlflngle combaj : he added, moreover, that, as the king ot 8cofcTand was the liege vassal of the king of England, he could not, without the king of England\'s consent, disinherit or banish a nobleman from his country for ever, especially if he was not convicted of a crime ; besides this, he said that the king of Scotland, to the prejudice of his allegiance and fealty, by which he was bound to the king of England, had received and protected in his territories, and at this very time was affording protection to, Geoffrey Marsh, a fugitive from Ireland, who was implicated in the treasonable crimes of his son William, who was lately condemned to death, and himg at London. The king of England was by this highly incensed against the king of Scotland ; but he reserved his anger till a fit time of retribution arrived, as the following narrative \^ilLahow.

414 MATTHEW PARIS. \[tLt\>. 124& The king of England renounces the truce, and deelaree war agaimtt the king of France. The king of England, during this time\^ had sent Ealph Fitz-Nicholas and Nicholas de Molis, as special messengers to the French king, to announce his determination, if he, the French king, would not agree to his demand\^ of fl-TumlliTig the truce, and commencing war against him. The messengers, on their arrival, found the French king besieging the castle of Frontenaye, belonging to the count de la Marche, which he unweariedly attacked day and night ; and by the assaults of his troops, by battering the walls with missiles from his stone-engines, and incessant showers of arrows, he had\^ so alarmed and harassed the besieged, that they were almost worn out, and could not much longer endure his fierce and uninterrupted assaults. In this castle there was one of the sons of the count de la Marche, by a former wife, a brave knight, with some most particular friends of the said count, whom he had placed there to defend this secure and well-fortified castle ; and these nobles the king was most eager to take, to strike terror into others. On the arrival of the king of England\'s messengers, the French king received them with honour and respect, and courteously invited them to breakfast at his table. On the following morning, therefore, they presented themselves before him, and cleverly and in due order, disclosed the messages enjoined on them, in the following words : --- \" Our lord, the king of England, your kinsman, sends word to you, that he is beyond measure astonished, that you have shamelessly broken the truce made between you and him, and confirmed by oath, on both sides, and wliich was still to have lasted for three years longer ; by which act you appear, otherwise than becomes you, to have shaken the proper stability of kingly faith.\" To this the king replied, with a calm look, --- \" The truce I never have broken, nor do I desire to do so --- \^indeed, I am keeping it inviolate ; and if the king of England please, I will prolong the term of it, without any remuneration, which, however, I do not usually do. Far be it from me, a king of France, in any way to violate a truce, or any treaty entered into between him and me, thus laying aside all reverence for God and respect for man, and showing no regard to the ties of

But tell your lord that I will abide by this truce for these three years, and will prolong it, if he pleases\^ for another three ; that is to say, for six years, from now, without any remuneration being made to me. Moreover, I willingly concede to him the province of Poictou, and the greatest part of Normandy, which is not a source of suspicion and alarm to me ; in which countries, he says, he has a right and expectations, in accordance with an oath made by my father, Louis, when he was in England, and by an old grant and permission of my ancestors ; on the condition, however, that I shall be allowed, without any opposition on his part, as justice demands, to punish any injury done to me or my kingdom, by my enemies, and traitors to me, however they may trust in him for assistance. Besides this, I have to inform the king of England, that it is a matter of astonish\^\" ment to me, that he --- \^by what spirit induced, or on what grounds I know not --- should say, that I have broken the truce made between us, if I attack people dwelling near or adjoining my kingdom, who do not even belong to him by right of homage, if they injure or rebel against me--- not to say those who are traitors to me. What has he to do with the affairs of the count de la Marche ? Aye ; what right has he to interfere in the matter of the count of Toulouse ? I made no truce with them ; nor were they mentioned in the truce. Moreover, by the very feet of his protecting and defending my enemies, he rather proves that he has violated the terms of the said truce, as well as the affection which ought to exist between relations. However, I have pror posed to act better and more mildly with respect to him ; and I still give him the offer of the above-mentioned terms of truce.\" The French king spoke all this with the greatest moderar tion, and without any deceit ; for he was much in fear of the \\ treachery of the king of Arragon, and the king of Castile, who were related to the king of England. He also feared the count of Toulouse, who had for a long time hated the French, who persecuted him ; the count de la Marche, who was protected by impregnable castles, and fattened by the money of the king of England ; he also feared the wavering\^l • , Normans, who were neighbours of. and united by a kind of I \^ affinity to, England.

The French king\'s message delivered to the king of England. The messengers, on receiving their reply, at once returned, and faithfully reported to the king of England all they had seen and heard ; he, however, would not on any account listen favourably to the peaceM wishes of the French king, or accept of his noble offer, replete with all peaceable inclinations ; for he was emboldened, and his feelings were per:. \\y verte4, by thosecjcrafby traitors, the Poictevins, who closedTEis \'eyes to the magnitude of the advantages offered to him, and promised him that, with their assistance, these territories, and more in addition, could be forcibly wrested from the French king\'s hands.

When the French king heard this, he repented of having offered such humble terms of peace to the king of England, and said to his nobles, \" I am sorry that the king of England, my relation, whom I wished to be my greatest friend, is so , infatuated that he gives heed more to the deceitful insinuaJ tions of the counts of La Marche and Toulouse, and their accomplices, one of whom is notorious for his treachery, and the other for heresy, than to my friendly messages. I am sorry that I am despised \\ but I neither fear him nor his forces, but only the confirmed oath of my father made in England ;\" and as he continued to lament inconsolably oyer this, one of his nobles, to comfort him, cleverly said, \" My lord king, you need not be in any alarm on this account, for on your father\'s departure from England, an inviolable oath was made on both sides, that neither of you would, on the occasion of a war breaking out, throw any injury to your enterprises either on the one side or the other ; which oath the

The French king was by these arguments inspired with greater confidence, and he more closely pressed the siege of the castle of Frontenaye, and at the same time collected a more numerous army, and distributed pay to his soldiers. They accordingly attacked the castle more fiercely than usual, and battered it so incessantly with the missiles from their mangonelles and other engines, whilst such numbers of the besieged were wounded by their arrows, that this castle, although one of the stvongest, was taken within fifteen days, contrary to the expectations of all the Poictevins, and the son of the count de la Marche and his allies were made prisoners. The count\'s son, together with his fellow-captives, was then brought at once into the king\'s presence, and several of the French earnestly begged that they might be hung, to strike terror into others ; but the king, becoming, as it were, a fisdth\^ ful advocate for his prisoner, said, \" He is not deserving of ( y death, if he had obeyed his father\'s commands even to death ; \[ nor are his associates, who have obeyed and &ithfully served their lord ; let them, however, be sent to Paris to be imprisoned ;\" which was done.

Those in charge of the castles belonging to the count de la Marche around him, went to the king and delivered their keys up to him, in order to make better terms.

The French king had now reached the noble castle of Vouvant, which belonged to the count de la Marche ; but as he was making preparations to besiege it, the constable in charge of it, after holding counsel with his companions, sent some of them with a peaceful message to the king ; for he was afraid that, if he were taken prisoner by force, the justice of the French would show him no mercy. He therefore, speedily and privately, consulted the count, his lord, on the matter, and sent word in the mean time to the French king, that if he would, in peace undisguised, grant to him and those with him, their Hves and their arms, he, the constable, would give up the castle to him, on condition, however, that, if peace should be restored between the king of France and the count de la Marche within three years, he, the French king, should restore the castle to their lord, the count de la Marche, without any dispute. The king, therefore, preferring to have possession of the castle entire, without any delay, rather than in a state of ruin from the missiles of his engines, during a prolonged siege, granted his demands ; and thus the castle immediately and without any trouble submitted to his authority. The count de la Marche repents qf his undertaking. At this news, fear and despair fell on the count de la Marche and all the Poictevins, as well as on all the inhabitants of Gascony and those whom the king of England had engaged to protect ; and the count bitterly repented of having rashly kicked against his lord, the French king.

When the French king was informed of these proceedings, he wrote to the count of Brittany, and to those inhabiting the sea-coast of that province, and to the governor of Rochelle, and those parts, as also to the sailors of Wissaut and Calais, and to those guarding the coasts of Normandy, ordering them to repel the attacks of the English, thus venting their fury by sea, and not to spare their persons or goods. In consequence of this order, owing to the increasing forces sent against them, the masters of the Cinque Ports suffered great loss, and were often shameftdly defeated ; in consequence of which they were compelled to demand assistance from the archbishop of York. The English king arrives at the city of Tailleburg, The king of England was at this time with his army, near the castle of Tonnaye, in the meadows near the river Charente, at which place he knighted his two brothers, the sons of the count de la Marche, and allotted to them a sum of money, to be received annually from his treasury, --- to one of them five hundred, and to the other six himdred marks, --- until he could provide them with a fixed amount of equal value in lands and revenues. Then, leaving that place with his army, he proceeded to the fields in front of the city of Tailleburg, on the same river Charente, and there he remained for six days. Flight of the king qf England. The French king, in the mean time, having received the submission of several chatelaines with their castles, became more confident, and raising his standard, directed his march towards the city of Tailleburg. This is a very fine city, rich in the great fertility of its vineyards, having a pleasant river near it, namely the deep and unfordable Charente, surrounded by rich meadows, and crossed by a strong bridge.

The king then received them into favour, and took them under his protection, and at once entered the city, taking up his abode there with some of his nobles, the rest pitching their tents in a field near the city. On the following day, which was the Sunday next before the feast of St. Mary Magdalen, he crossed the bridge and made arrangements to proceed with his army to the more distant parts of Poictou ; but information of this intended proceeds ing beiug carried to the king of England and his nobles\^ amongst whom the count de la Marche was the chie\^ that monarch, by the count\'s advice, drew out his troops by night, and suddenly came with his army to the field connected with the bridge, and pitching his tents there, he took up his quarters opposite the city; so that one army could overlook the other. The English king\'s army consisted of sixteen hundred knights, twenty thousand foot-soldiers, and seven hundred cross-bowmen. There was a king on one side near the river, and on the other side, likewise near the river, was the other king. Early in the morning the English beheld the oriflamme of the French king, and the tents and standards of his army, whilst the other bank of the river was covered with a multitude of tents, appearing like a large and populous city. At this sight the king of England, who expected nothing else than a battle, and that he should surprise the French at the sword\'s point, some of the English being even stationed to guard the passage of the bridge, said to the count de la Marche, \" Where are now your promises, my lord and father ?

This took place on Sunday. On the earl\'s arrival at the French army, ) he was received by them with the greatest honour, and nimabers \"\^ of them called him their redeemer, because by the peace which he had made in the Holy Land he had released them ; from captivity. He was then summoned with respect into\'\^ the presence of the king, and on making known to him his wish, namely, to obtain a truce, it was, after some trouble, granted to him till the morrow : this he obtained for several reasons, because he wa\^ a person in great favour with the French, owing to his liberation of their nobles in the Holy Land, before mentioned ; again, because he was a relation of the French king; and, also, because it was Sunday. The French king, on taking leave of the earl, as he was departing said to him, \" My lord earl, my lord earl\^ I have granted you this truce to last to-day and to-night, in order that you may deliberate as to what is best to be done in future, for night brings counsel with it.\" The earl replied, \" On that account I asked the truce which I have obtained.\" He then immediately returned to the king of England, and whispered quietly in his ear, \*\* Quick, quick, let us remove ourselves from this place, for we are in imminent danger of being taken prisoners.\" They then took a hasty meal together (for it was noon), and as the sun declined, each man busied himself in collecting his baggage together, and when darkness came on, the king, who had now had experience of the faith, or rather the faithlessness, of the Poictevins, disgracefully \^retreated, and did not spare the spur. He was followed bi the whole army, not without much danger to horses and men ; for they were many of them dinnerless, and the horses were fatigued.

As the two parties rushed on one another, loud cries were raised, on one side, \^ King\'s men, king\'s men,\" on the other, \" Montjoie, montjoie,\" which were the rallying cries oi the two kings. The shouts of the combatants reached the king of England at Saintonge, and he was told that the count de la March e, as he had commenced the war, wished either to lose his life or redeem his fame. The armies on both sides being now aroused, a fierce conflict took place outside the town of Saintonge, in the narrow roads between the vine\* yards. The English, in their rage, attacked the French at the sword\'s point, and fought most desperately, so that, ii they had equalled their enemies in number, they would have succeeded in gaining a glorious victory over the French, as the latter themselves bore evidence after the battle. In this battle, Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, the earls of Salisbury and Norfolk, Roger Bigod, John de Burg, \"Warren de Montchesnil, Hubert Fitz-Matthew, Ealph Fitz-Nicholas, and many other brave Englishmen, gained lasting renown, as even their rivals allowed. On the French side, John de Barres, with six knights, was taken prisoner by William de Say, but they were afterwards exchaiiged for a like number of English prisoners. Many others of the French also were taken prisoners ; amongst them Perer Orige, seneschal of the count of Boulogne, was taken by John Mansell, a clerk and especial councillor of the king of England, who was reckoned

The count de la Marche eecretly endeavours to he reconciled to the French king\^ As the French king\'s army increased daily, like a lake that »/ is swollen by torrents of rain, the coimt de la Marche began to be more seriously alarmed, for of late, sinister reports had daily wounded his heart ; first, the capture of the castle of Frontenaye, at which his son, and forty knights with him, besides a great many more brave retainers, had been made prisoners, and a quantity of arms seized, and in that castle were concentred all his hopes and confidence. He next lost the castle of Vouvant, in which were garrisoned a himdred and forty knights, and about sixty armed cross-bowmen ; then the castle of Vilers, with several other castles and towns with their chatelaines and garrisons ; and finally Fontenaye was taken with the adjacent districts. Urged, therefore, by the I ..-\^ \^ internal grief of lus heart, and actuated by fear and despair, I »\' although he concealed the trouble of his mind under a calm \|\\ \* . ) countenance, the said count began to waver, and to consider nV \^\" by whose mediation he could again be received into favour by his lord the French king, whose anger he had deservedly incurred. After some consideration, he sent privately to the count of Brittany, an old friend of his --- \^himself a traitor, sending to another traitor --- \^and begged him, in conjunction with the bishop of Saintonge, with all possible (filigence, secretly and cautiously to endeavour to restore him to the favour of the French king. The count of Brittany accordingly went with the bishop of Saintonge to the king, and smilingly said, \" This war has been cut short as if by a weaver :\" and afte; giving utterance to some more soft and flattering insinuations, he continued his discourse, and in the hearing of the aforesaid bishop, and some few other French nobles, whom he had sent for to this council, he said, \" My lord king, your subject, the count de la Marche, who acknowledges that he has grievously offended you and your crown, asks of you not judgment but mercy, as the common proverb says,

When these conditions and obligations for obtaining the French king\'s favours were made known by the said count of Brittany to the count de la Marehe, he was deeply grieved, and for a long time refused to agree to them ; but finally, by the advice of the said count cf Brittany, and other secret friends of his, in whom he had confidence, he, although not without bitterness of heart, agreed to them, to prevent anything worse from happening tojiim. He therefore left his son, the king of England, whose X\^on\^ he had now in a great measure eidiausted, and fled to tHeFrench army ; and throwing himself on his knees before the king, he obtained his fitvour, which he did not deserve. He was then at once sent with the same count of Brittany to make war on the count of Toulousey who, being united to the king of England by the ties of blood, as well as a sworn ally, still continued the war against the French king. Owing to this, the count of Toulouse from that time employed himself in looking to his own defence\^ and was unable to assist the king of England, to whom he had promised effective assistance on the receipt of money beforehand. In the same way the king of England could not obtain assistance from the king of Arragon, owing to the roads being stopped against him, nor from any one else in whom he had placed his confidence. At the same time the count of Toulouse came privately to the king of England, and, after making excuses for himself, said, \" Do not despair, my lord king and cousin ; do not despair, most potent prince, of being able to repel the French king, since you may remember that I alone, with the pope\'s assistance, repulsed him ; and I, as soon as I have driven out of my territories these traitors to you, who are now overrunning them, will hasten with all speed, to your assistance ;\" and after a little further conversation, the said count went\^way loaded with presents.

426 HATTHEW PARI& \[a.i\>. 1242i The cause of the king\*s losing Saintonge\* Wliilst the count de la Marche was carrying his beforementioned treacherous plans into eflFect without the knowledge of the king of England, the latter was staying for some days at Saintonge (which by right of old was known to be the special property and residence of the king of England), and afterwards, without consulting the citizens, and even against their wish, he gave that city, and confirmed his gift by charter, to Hugh Brun, son of the count de la Marche, and a younger brother of his own. The citizens hated this said Hugh, as being a proud and evil-disposed man, and who often had threatened to oppress them ; and, in consequence of this gift, the citizens could no longer look with a favourable eye on the king of England, nor approve of his behaviour and actions. The English hinges flight to Blaye, As the laborious month of August drew rear, whilst the king of England, thinking he had a safe and sure place of refiige at Saintonge, was purposing to stay there a few days for the sake of gaining breathing-time, a French knight, one of those who had been liberated in the Holy Land by Earl Bichard, and who was privy to the plans of the French king, sent word secretly and hastily to the said earl, that the French king had devised and determined on a secret plan, suddenly to surround the king of England in the city of SaLa-\^ tonge, with intrenchments from all parts, and to besiege him there ; that, as soon as he had collected his forces, such as France is known to be able to produce, he would continue the siege, and never leave it till he had made prisoners of all the English there, together with their king, and carried them bound prisoners to Paris. The same messenger also added hastily and nearly breathless, that the count de la Marche had been converted, or rather averted, and, from being a friend, had become the greatest enemy of the king of England, --- from a false father becoming a stepfather, --- and that he could not hope for anything else from the other nobles of Poictou. Scarcely had he ceased speaking, when another messenger came to the king, sent by his younger brother, the aforesaid H., and Guy de Lusignan his elder brother, declaring that if

A.I\>. 1242.} FLIGHT OF THE ENGLISH KING. 427 the English remained in the town that night, they would either be all taken prisoners, with their king and the citizens, or would be blockaded till they were taken. This took place on the morrow of St. Pantaleon\'s day, when the king had come from the Pons through Archiac thence to Herbizi, and had come to Saintonge, his home as it were. But when they were about to take up their quarters, and the agents in advance, and the proctors and marshals had all prepared their breakfasts, and the king himself was on the point ot taking breakfast, the second messenger arrived corroborating the evidence of the first, thereby leaving no room for doubt in the matter; on which the king at once left the city, giving orders for it to be burnt ; for, as he had heard from the before-mentioned messenger, the citizens had arranged terms of peace with the French king, and treacherously revealed all his secret plans to that monarch. King Henry, then, did not spare the spur, or the sides of his horse, but fled without stopping to the city of Blaye, hungry and fasting as he was, and troubling little as to who of his troops followed him. His nobles, when they became aware of his flight, suddenly left their half-cooked food, and, mounting swift horses, followed their king in haste, and begged refuge for themselves with him at the city of Blaye. A numerous host of English followed their track on foot, in the greatest necessity, and, failing from hunger and weakness, they lost such a number of sickly men and laden horses, waggons, and carts, that tears of compassion rose to the eyes of all who saw their condition, for it was a journey of twenty miles according to the computation of that country, but about forty, or nearer fifty, according to English reckoning ; and if they had not sustained themselves on the journey by eating fir-apples and berries, their strength would have entirely failed them. The French king in the mean time arrived at Saintonge, where he was received with respect by the clergy and citizens, and without any difficulty regained his authority over that noble city. After a disgraceful and destructive flight, the harassed and scarcely-breathing English reached the city of Blaye, and the king, after staying there a fe\^ days to rest and restore his strength (for he had not eaten a meal or slept for two days and two nights), determined to leave that place also, to seek a safer place of refuge ; he therefore held counsel

In this flight the king of England lost his chaplet, that is, all his most costly sacerdotal ornaments, be»des reliques, and many other things too numerous to mention. During his flight towards Blaye, the French king hotly pursued him till he arrived at a place called Cartel\^fue, where he was obliged to halt through illness. The city of Pons surrendered to the French king. Keginald de Pons, on hearing this news, flew at once to the wings of the French king, and by the intervention of friends sought for peace, which he with some difficulty ob-r tained, and surrendered himself and city to the French king\'s authority. The French king garrisons the city qf Pons and some castles. The city of Pons being thus brought to subjection, as well as some other castles around it, the French king at once expelled the Poictevins, and established some of his fJEiithful French therein. Archbishop William deserts to the French king. When these events came to the knowledge of the socalled Archbishop William, he also determined to act in a / similar way, but determined first to fatten himself on the \^ property of the king of England. He therefore deceitfully sent a peaceful and consolatory message to the said king, declaring and calling the Divine judgment to witness, that, although all the Poictevins should bend and basely backslide from him, he, the archbishop, would never, as long as the breath of life palpitated in his bosom, abandon the Mng of England, who had bestowed such wealth on him, and flee to the French, whose intolerable pride, after they gained power, trampled on all subject to them, as if they were the mud of the streets. He therefore begged of the king of England, as his natural lord, from whom he could not separate himself, without delay to send some valorous knights, equipped with all necessaries, to defend his city of Parthc\*liaye, and with money to fortify it. To these soft and \' honeyed speeches the king gave a too willing ear, and acted : according to his request : biiib on the arrival of the knights \'sent to assist him by the king of England, he drove them away by force from the city, but retained to himself the

He, then, with all his dependants and the citizens, flew to the wings of the French king, to make peace ; but the French, however, taunted and reproached him, tore out his tongue, and pointing at him with the finger, reproached him for his conduct, and denounced him aa a traitor, and aa a man branded with the mark of Cain« The fheriff of Tuonan turns from the English Jnngm The sheriff of Thouars, too, on becoming acquainted with the state of matters, a man on whom the king of England had heaped great and numerous benefits, and whose advancement he had promoted in many ways, affcerhe found hia \\ packsaddles well filled with good(gterliDg moSfe\^ thought in ) return of betraying him ; and by the mterveiilion of friends he made his peace with the French king ; his city was restored to him, together with the adjacent towns, and he joined the French army ; thus plainly showing what confidence ought to be placed in the faith of the Poictevins. The whole of Poiciou turns to the French king. The citizens and guardians of the towns, then, seeing that those of higher rank than themselves had turned, and that the king of England, who ought to have protected jhem, had \\j\^ (flei, as a sailor abandons a sinking ship, vied with one another in flying to the well-known rule of the French king; and all their fellow-provincials, too, at once gave themselves and their property up to him.

I am left to myself, and, therefore, fly to your majesty ; receive, then, my castles --- and at the same time, accept of my service.\" To this the French king replied, with a calm look, --- \" My friend, it is well known to me that , you have been to the king of England, and what you said N / to him.

Of their arniy, eighty nobles who carried standards died, and of the foot-soldiers, about twenty thousand fell victims. The king himself was at this time also taken seriously ill, and great fear and despair fell upon all the French, for they feared that they should lose their king by the hands of death, who spares no one, in the same way as they had suddenly lost his father Louis, at Avignon ; for he was an effeminate and delicate young man. By the same disease, also, many brave and incomparable knights died ; amongst whom were Robert Malet, a Norman, a man worthy of distinguished praise, and Richard Beaumont, a man of noble birth, and distinguished amongst the French for noble deeds, and one whom Earl Richard had liberated in the Holy Land. The French king was therefore compelled by adverse circumstances to agree to a truce for five years, which was demanded by the king of England, and to return into France to his accustoiaed climate, the truce being willingly, nay, jojrfolly, granted to him.

The French king, therefore, on a sudden changed his plans, and returned into France, in order to gain breathing-time, both because the king of England was preparing to remove to a distant part of the coimtry, and it would be difficult to pursue him into his own territories, and also because the inclement season of winter was close at hand. Taking his way, then, by the city of Saintonge, which he had regained possession of, he ordered it to be fortified, for the advantage of the French kingdom, with new walls and outworks, and the old ones to be repaired : he gave the same orders with regard to other cities, and received the oath of fidelity, and hostageS; from those in charge of them, and the castles he garrisoned with French chatelaines, and those who were

The French king shortly after convoked the ordained prelates of the French kingdom at Paris ; namely, archbishops, bishops, abbats, priors of the Black, Cistercian, and PrsemonBtrate orders, and the proctors of cathedral chapters, and demanded pecuniary assistance from them ; and that no reasonable grounds for his being refused might appear, he \^y (♦\> gave as a reason that he wished to attack the heretic Albi- \^i\'-\'\' \^\^\\ genses. For he accused the count of Toulouse of the old \^\^\'-\^ crime of heresy ; as a proof of which he stated, that the said count had lately basely slain some of the Preacher brethren. The prelates, therefore, knowing that they were deprived of the government of the pope, although they were not bound by right, at the command of any secidar person, to contribute anything so as to oppress the Church, yet, considering that the times were bad, and \^that, where there is a nximber included in the danger, some relaxation must be allowed to strict rules, unanimously compromised the matter by granting the twentieth part of their revenues for that year, to be paid at a short period.

In this year, Adam, abbat of Waredon, was confirmed bishop of Connor, a see in Ireland subject to the metropolitan diocese of the archbishop of Armagh. Some of the nobles of England ask leave to rettam home. About the same time, Earl Bigod, Earl Roger of Winchester, and several other nobles, came to the king, and complained severely to him that he had unadvisedly dragged them from their own homes into the remote provinces of those who were traitors to him, without affording them any comfort or assistance ; wherefore, when the French king with his army retired to the interior of France, to recruit their strength, they aLso asked leave to depart and return to England for a similar purpose. The English king asked them, \" Is the road safe ?\" to which they replied, \" \"We will ask.\" They then asked a free transit through France from the French king, which he granted them, saying, \" Let them depart free, and proceed without hindrance through my teiTitory, I hope never to return.\" Being blamed for this by his nobles, he said, \" I wish all my enemies to travel to a distance from me, never to return.\" The English therefore, took their way in peace through France, --- not, however, without incurring the derision of the inhabitants, --- and returned to England. It happened about the same time, that one of the English nobles, named William de Boos, who came from the northern parts of England, had not the means of stajdng any longer with the king on the continent, whereupon the king precipitately ordered him to be disseised of his lands, although without the judgment of his peers. This appeared to all to be an unjust and tyrannical action ; for as the said William de Boos was a poor man, he said to the king, \" Accept my lands under the name of a pledge, and grant me the means of serving you properly as a knight, and then I will stay.\" Earl Bichard, hearing of these and other similar proceedings, severely reproached his brother, and a dispute arising between them in consequence, he left his brother in bitterness of spirit, and, determining to return

On the feast of St. Luke, the aforesaid nobles set sail, and after enduring many dangers and much trouble on the voyage, arrived with much difficulty at ComwalL Earl Richard, after making a vow to visit a certain abbey for the preservation of his soul, was with much difficulty saved from the jaws of death, and landed on an island near Cornwall ; the other ships, which had left the French coast at the same time as Earl Richard\'s ship, were dispersed by the violence of the tempest, and carried to other shores.

Such deluges of rain fell, that the river Thames, overflowing its usual bounds and its ancient banks, spread itself over the country towards Lambeth, for six miles, and took possession, far and wide, of the houses and fields in that part. Owing to the inundation of the water, people rode into the great hall at Westminster on horseback. 2f2

The archbishop, however, being a wise and considerate man, knew that they were not to be blamed, if they had, on the king\'s making a truce, left him for a time, owing to poverty overtaking them, or for the sake of recruiting their health, and would not, at this tyrannical order, compromise the gravity of bis character for such a word of no import, but ipreferred to let it pass over in silence. Especially as the king had been reluctant to assent to the wise counsels either of Earl Bichard, his brother, and of others of his trusty subjects, --- viz., that it would be better for him to return to his own kingdom, --- \^but chose rather the soft speeches of the Gascons, and to remain at Bordeaux with his queen, amid the derision and raiUeries of the French, much to his own disadvantage.

There is a certain monastery called V6rines, where the king\'s rebels took refuge, and made the church into a castle, or rather into a robber\'s cave. This fortress was hotly besieged and attacked by the king\'s faithful servants, but without success, when one of the king\'s clerks and special councillors, named John Mansel, a man brave in arms and of undaunted spirit, reproached the assailants with their slothfulness and loss of time ; and just as he was setting an example to the others by more effectually rising up against the enemies, and wishing to prepare a road, one of the besieged, situated in a higher part of the chmxih, shot on the said clerk a stone of great weight, and crushed his leg with the joints and marrow in his bones. And while the same man was preparing to overwhelm the rest of his body with stones, his friends, who were most sincerely attached to him, covered him with their own bodies and large shields, called targets, and thus with difficulty freed him from the peril of death. And the same John, severely wounded in body, was for a long time languishing and weak.

But the archbishop was greatly astonished at this, as he had sent him money and a large quantity of provisions. \"Wherefore, he finnly believed and feared that the avenging anger of the Creator had destroyed them all by sinking them into the depths of the sea.

They, moreover, truly asserted that neither they themselves, nor even the whole of the English fleet, could withstand the fleet prepared by this enemy. And they added, \" Let the council of the king provide against the hidden treacheries and the open irruptions which are and which will be prepared against themselves, and against us, and which are threatening to become every time more fearful and more stubborn.

And he said jokingly to the king, by way of apostrophe : --- • In terris galeas, in aquis formido galeias : Inter eas et eas ; consulo cautus eas. \[Arms on the land, and ships by sea, we fear ; \' Between the two, yon should with caution steer.\] ■ The election of a pope is impeded by the diesenmns of the cardinals f and the papal chair remains vacant. Also, at that very time, the emperor Frederick signified his wish to the cardinals, who were in different places, and of different opinions, that they should meet together and unanimously elect a pope. And he assured them that for thi\^ their fault, he had himself suffered no small stigma. For it was believed and asserted by many who were ignorant of the truth of the affaii\*, that he himself was the chief hinderance to the welfare of the Church of Rome, and was the cause of the apostolic chair remaining empty. But the cardinals, who did not find the smallest spark of charity, not even a little flame under the cinders, through the machinations of Satan, the old enemy of the human race, were neither unanimous in their desires, nor willing to assemble for the purpose of electing a Roman pontiff. However, they instantly prayed their lord, the emperor Frederick, that if he wished to be considered as an upholder of the peace and liberty of the Church, to permit the prelates of the Church, whom as yet he held incarcerated, to depart free, under the most sure hope of a happy peace. The emperor Frederick sets the legates and captive prelates at liberty. The emperor, therefore, placing implicit confidence in the words of the

But the cardinals, still obstinate, and remaining in dissension and mutual hatred, and, as it were, cajoling the emperor, Satan sowing discord among them, were still unwilling to meet together, and with one voice invoke and pray for the grace of the Holy Spirit, and provide happily and properly for the Church universal, and the papal chair : although when lately liberated from the emperor\'s prison, they promised the emperor, their liberator, that by a strict investigation of the truth, and by the word of truth, which is God, they would, to the best of their ability, procure a peace for the Church, suitable to the empire, and a dignitary for the papal seat. The emperor givet up to his soldiers the cardinals\* possessions. When the emperor Frederick found that their promises were void of effect, and that he had been deceived in his hopes, he fell into a violent passion ; and having assembled a large army, composed of nine bodies, each body containing five thousand cavalry, he besieged the greater part of Home, to punish those citizens as well as cardinals who appeared to be the authors and furtherers of this schism so destructive to the Church and empire. But the citizens on whose account the emperor had determined to attack the city, legally excused themselves, sufficiently proving their innocence ; and they asserted that the cardinals were no more divided in spirit than in body, and were dispersed and concealed in different towns. Where-, upon the emperor ordered the siege to be raised, and this imperial edict to be proclaimed and commanded throughout all the army : --- \'\* That all the possessions and churches of cardinals and estates pertaining to the Church should be given up to be despoiled by the army.\" The cardinals, in fear, meet together to elect a pope.

And when the army was ready to lay waste with similar fury the other possessions of the Church, the cardinals sent to their lord the emperor, humbly praying him to spare his anger, and order his despoilers to stop, that they might at once, according to his precept and wish, having God before their eyes, forthwith choose a Boman pontile fitting to the Church and the empire, \'the emperor was thereupon appeased, and he with an imperial edict stopped the ravages of his devastators. Money is extorted from the citizens of London, About the same time, the citizens of London were aggrieved by a very heavy impost called a tallage, under this form : --- The collectors and royal officers came to such and such a citizen, saying, \" You must lend such and such a sum of money to our lord the king, who is fighting in foreign parts for the interests of the kingdom, till he returns bome.\" And according to the will and valuation of these extortions, the citizens were deprived of their money.

On St. George\'s day, the truce which had been concluded and heretofore agreed on between the king of France and the king of England, was confirmed on both sides for five years, through the intervention of wise and discreet men, who were friends of both parties. Every conquest which the king of France had made in that expedition was to remain to him. Moreover, some towns were restored to the king of France\'s domination, which, after the king of France had retired from the county of Poictou, the king of England had

To obtain liberally the rifforous observation of this treaty as well by land as by 8ea diLig the said time, the king of England engaged t\^ pay faithfully to the king of France five thousand pounds sterling, namely, one thousand in each year. But the count of Brittany, a crafty and wily man, pretended to be ignorant of all these things, and after the manner of pirates vigilantly applied himself to plunder and rapine on the sea with his galleys and other vessels, unwilling to come to the shore, lest a royal mandate should restrain his wicked and mis-\^ chievous expeditions. And among the other deeds which the said count of Brittany wickedly perpetrated, he captured and pillaged a very large merchant ship of Bayonne, laden with figs and almonds, and various spices, bound for and sailing towards England, near the time of Lent. Then the king of France, at the request of the king of England, restrained and checked the mischievous attacks of the said count, under a threat of disinheritance. Deaih of Hugh d\*Albinett earl of Arundel, On the 7th of May, in the same year, died Hugh d\'Albinet, earl of Arundel, in the flower of his youth, having scarcely passed the bounds of juvenility.

At the same time, on the 12th of May, the earl of Kent, i.e. Hubert de Burgh, full of years, in the most praiseworthy manner ended his days at his manor of Banstead, afber having sustained many arbitrary attacks and persecutions from the king, and many changes of fortune.

About this time, our lord the king, seeing that fortune opposed him in everything, and now discovering that his faithful English followers had told him the truth, came to himself again, although rather late, and repented that he had not yielded to their salutary counsels. He therefore signified to the archbishop of York to prepare a fleet whence he could, and to send it to meet him, that, on his journey, he might the more effectually avoid the snares of his enemies, if by chance any such were prepared. For he should be about to return shortly to England. He also gave orders that all the English nobles should receive him with joy on the shore when he debarked. A very powerful fleet having been sent to meet him, the result of this order was to impoverish most miserably the English nobles, who were daily awaiting him on the shore at Portsmouth, not without incurring great expenses and suflfering wearisomeness, for he delayed his return till the feast of St. Michael, as the queen was great either with child or some other infirmity. Moreover, the people of Bordeaux, in fact all the Grascons, finding that the king\'s delay was most profitable to them, were seeking every possible means to prevail upon the king to winter with them, and squander uselessly to himself, but profitably to them, what he would extort and had extorted from his kingdom. And it happened soon after, that when the king was about to leave Bordeaux, and had appointed Nicholas de Molis as a fit person to act as governor, whom they call seneschal, and had taken all precautions for the safety of the land, and had embarked, and was even ploughing the depths of the sea, sailing towards England, a furious quarrel having arisen among those Gascons, the king was hastily recalled by galleys sent after him, and compelled to return, that he might quell the great disturbance which had arisen. Thus his journey into England was impeded by many obstacles.

448 MATTHEW PARIS. \[a.D. 124\^. vent of Canterbury and the bishop of Lincohi, after this manner. A certain clerk importunately demanded of the abbat of Bardeney a certain debt, which was one of those contracted by the predecessor of the same abbat. And when a controversy arose upon this, the archdeacon of Lincoln, wishing to lower the would-be pontifical dignity of the said abbat and his convent, in which they had long rejoiced without molestation, said to the said clerk, when demanding the above-mentioned debt, \"Lay complaint before me in a grave and proper form concerning this injury which you have sustained, and I, subduing those hitherto unsubdued monks, your adversaries, will restore all the debt to you, extorting it by force from them if necessary.\" He, therefore, following the advice of this caviller, made a heavy complaint against the abbat and monks publicly before the archdeacon, who cited the abbat to appear before him, even within his rights, to answer to the law on this head ; which when the abbat perceived was against the law of the Church and against custom, he made a contradictory appeal. Then the archdeacon, finding himself lawfully opposed, cited the abbat to appear elsewhere. But the abbat said \" No ;\*\* resting on his former appeal ; for he knew that he was plotting against him, and was seeking nothing but a pretext for disturbing his liberty and rendering it nulL Many former attempts, which this last confirmed, made him acquainted that such was the design of his enemy. He knew, moreover, that if this plaint were brought before the bishop (which the archdeacon was cunningly contriving to do), that the bishop would be favourable to the monks\' subversion, as he was regarded as the general persecutor of religious recluses, and especially religious privileges which he could oppose. The archdeacon, therefore, seeking a cause for creating strife, and making a difficulty where none could be found, complained of this opposition to the bishop. The bishop then cited the abbat to answer these manifold offenoea But the abbat, relying stead&stly upon his former appeal, refused to obey this citation, knowing that the bishop was easilyprovoked to anger, and, in this case, would show fiivour to his archdeacon. Whereupon the bishop, highly incensed and swelling with rage, more than was seemly, excommunicated the said abbat on the spot, as rebellious ; which the abbat

A few days after this, the bishop sent inspectors to Bardeney, seculars, more ready to insult the monks than to correct abuses, if any could be found. They, therefore, refused them admittance, because they came in the name of the bishop, their open enemy, and were evilly disposed ; next, because they were seculars, and totally ignorant of monastic discipline ; then because their abbat, who was their pastor and leader, and without whom they could take no measures, was enveloped in the chains of excommunication by the sentence of the said bishop. The inspectors thereupon becoming insulting, and even threatening, and having exposed themselves to violence by their provocations, the porters repulsed them, and, having shut the door, said, \'\* We himibly beseech you to depart quickly, before many of the exasperated people about here make a rush upon yoa ; although it would be against our will, we could not chec)r their violence.\" They then departed making threats, aQ\^ complained of these things to the bishop, exaggerating a great deal, and saying that the monks had men armed ifO rush upon them, and that the monks\' servants cudgelled them,--- thus impudently transgressing from the bounds of truth. The bidiop, therefore, provoked to anger beyond measure, threatened to bring ruin and confusion upon the abbat and the convent, to the best of his power. The abbat, therefore, afflicted with grie\^ was thinking what, could be done. Having been informed by inquiry that the convent of Canterbury had the privilege of receiving and hearing appeals during the vacancy of the papal seat, he had recourse to this remedy, and laid a severe complaint of the injuries he had sustained. Whereupon the bishop, very indignant, having assembled at Hertford Adam, bishop of Connor, and some abbats of the Black order who were in his diocese, viz., those of Ramsey and Peterborough, there ignominiously deposed the said abbat of Bardeney, in his absence, and having nobody to answer for him, as though convicted and rebellious ; pretending that the abbat had not regularly proceeded in his appeal, and had not commenced by complaining to him who was his bishop. He also made known to the convent of Bardeney, that they were not boimd to obey him in anything, but VOL. I. 2 a

But when the bishop received the letters of this sentence\^ he contemptuously threw it on the ground, and stamped upon it, to the great astonishment of those who saw Idnv because the image of St. Thomas was stamped on the wax ; and he was enraged to such a pitch, that he said to all his hearers, \'\^ I do not ask that the monks should pray otherwise for my soul to all eternity.\" And having loaded the messenger with abuse, he ordered him to be seized. And as his servants were reluctant and afiraid to do this, on account of reverence for the priesthood (for he was a priest who was sent), he ordered the same priest to be turned out of the house, like a vile slave or even a robber, which greatly increased the surprise and astonishment of all those discreet and learned persons who were in the house ; and even if there were no other cause, the said priest might reasonably have accused the bishop of laying violent hands on him ; but the said bishop, paying little regard to the monks\' sentence, and even deriding it» did not discontinue to exercise his priestly functions, to dedicate churches, and to proceed in his other pontifical duties, without thinking that, though the sentence might be imjust, yet, from his contempt of courts it might become formidable against him. Tke French demand thai a pope ehonld be elected. About the same time, the French sent formal messengers to the Koman senate, to intimate, in the most persuasive manner, their wish precisely and efficaciously that the cardinals\^ regularly electing a pope, should provide with deliberation for the Catholic Churdi the solace of a pastor, and that if they ; persevered in their negligence, they would, without delay, elect and provide a sovereign pontiff on this side of the mountains, whom they would be sworn to obey.

Thus, if they were real stars (which no wise man can think), there would not have been one left in the heavens.

At that time also, namely about the feast of St. Kemy, the king of England, having settled what was to be settled in Gascony, and having intrusted the government of the land to Nicholas de Molis, a very brave and prudent soldier, whom he created seneschal of Gascony, and taking ship, had a most pleasant voyage across the Channel\^ and returned into England ; he landed at Portsmouth on the 25th of September. Whereupon he instantly intimated to the abbats and priors that they should procure horses, two-horse carriages, ai\^d outriders going before to announce him, with their necessary appurtenances, as he was altogether destitute of such things, that the English might know directly of their king\'s approach ; and when he had come to Winchester, where almost all the English nobles came to meet him, and greet him, he gave orders that the city should be adorned at his entry with hangings and curtains, with garlands and lighted tapers ; that the citizens should meet him in their holiday dresses, and that all the bells of the place should resound with joy. Moreover, he caused to be proclaimed by the voice of a herald, by the means of the swiftest messengers, that four of the most important dtizens or burgesses of each city or borough should come out to meet him, habited in rich garments, and mounted on costly chargers. So, according to his order and edict, which was obliged to be obeyed, many were compelled to hasten from the most distant parts of the kingdom to meet him, not without great expense and trouble. And when he was approaching London, citizens in holiday garb, mounted on most expensive horses, and newly equipped, met him on the way in procession, each vying with the rest to be first to meet the then king, whom they tespectftilly saluted, and won over by their various and valuable gifts. And at the approach of the festivity of St. Edward, that is, on the 13th of October, the king ordered also that the convent, habited in their canonicals, should advance

Innocent IV. elected pope. Also in that year, on the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, the lord cardinal Sinibald was elected pope, after the papal chair had been vacant a year and nine months ; and he was consecrated on the day of the apostles Peter and Paul, and called Innocent the Fourth, after which he immediately confirmed the sentence pronounced against the emperor Fi\*ederick by his predecessor Gregory. He was created pope at Anagni ; --- so the Komans and their emperor, irritated as by a double injury, prepared to perse«mte the new pope, and plotted snares against him, and that the more readily because the emperor had reckoned upon the pope being favourable towards him. The emperor, therefore, placed vigilant sentinels in the way of the roads and ports, and galleys on the sea, that the bearers of the bulls might not sail away rejoicing in a free transit. And not a great while after this, the emperor seized two brothers of the order of Minorites ; whom, as they were furtively carrying, by order of their superiors, letters destined to excite war between certain nobles, chiefly against the emperor, he ordered to be immediately hanged.

The king received from each Jew, whether man or woman, the gold into his own hand, becoming, from a king, a new kind of tax-gatherer ; but the silver was received by others for the king.

She came in great state, and with very pompous pageantry. A great number of English nobles went to attend her by the king\'s order, on the sea-shore, so as to avoid all disagreeable delay. On the octaves of St. Martin\^ as the said countess was then to arrive in London, the king ordered that the city of London should be decorated with hangings, curtains, and divers other ornaments, from the bridge to Westminster, and that they should put out of the sight of those who passed through the city, blocks of wood, mud, dirt, and all obstacles.

This I say, that all Christ\'s faithful followers may see the evidence of the miracle, and the just vengeance which Alban, the protomartyr of England, inflicted upon him. Li fact, after having been for three years lying under a sentence, and having insolently despised the keys of the Church, he, in the palace of Westminster, tossing up his head, said to many there assembled : --- \" Ha ! what do you say about the monks of St. Alban\'s 1 Eh ! what do you say about them 1 They have excommunicated me so long a time, so often, and so effectually, that I am much the better for it --- \^fat, and well --- and so stout, that I can hardly get into my saddle, when I ride on horseback.\" Scarcely had he finished, when he was suddenly struck with infirmity and lack of strength, and in a desperate state, scarcely breathing, he was carried home.

In order that, if he died, he might not fe.ll into the abyss of despair, and so utterly perish in damnation, because of his crimes, they granted him the benefit of absolution, when he had promised to make reparation for the injuries and wickednesses committed by him. Similarly, also, a great number of others, --- among the rest, powerful knights, usurpers on, and disturbers of) the liberties of the said martyr\'s church, --- suffered a little while after a similar or more severe punishment by the judgment of a miraculous vengeance.

And when the aforesaid bishop came to visit his cathedral church of Winchester, and wished to enter that city, the king ordered its gates to be strictly guarded. But the prior of Winchester, if he is worthy to be looked upon as a prior, or to be called by such a name, combined together a great part of the monks to form a conspiracy, and lifb up their heel against their bishop\^ asserting publicly that all who should afford him aid or advice would be open enemies of our lord the king, and. should be severely punished for the same ; so that there was a schism between both the monks and the secular clergy, and a shocking strife, which was carried even to the shedding of blood.

The king also sent letters to Oxford, to defsme the same bishop in the eyes of the university, asserting that he had obtained consent by fals& statements from our lord the pope, that he should be nominated and translated to the bishopric of Winchester, and that the king would unveil and clearly prove and expose all the deceit which he had practised before the Boman court and the kingdom of England. To put this into execution, he at once got ready some Rome-footed couriers to do his message. He also caused the bishopric of Norwich to be confiscated, that every means of consolation might be removed on all sides from the bishop aforesaid.

At that time, the oppressions exercised by the imperial officers upon the inhabitants of Yiterbo, determined that city and the surrounding country to turn to the Bonoans, who upheld the pope. Oppressed, therefore, and weiirhed 4own with a yoke of unamistomed servitude, when they had turned themselves and their city over to the other party, they fled to the cardinal Eegnier de Yiterbo, that with his aid aiid counsel they might enter into alliance with the Romans, and, forgetting all ancient quarrels, become one people, that they might so be stronger to rise against their enemies, and more securely remove themselves from the imperial grievances, by thus avoiding them. Thereupon, through the diligent labour of the said Regnier, a conspiracy was brought about suddenly and secretly, and the Bdmans coming in great numbers, and prudently seizing all the imperial guards, led them, thus taken captives, back to Kome, to be imprisoned, a treaty having been first concluded between the Romans and the people of Yiterbo ; and in the place of imperial magistrates, they substituted their own people, Romans as well as Yiterbians, in the towers of the castles, and in fortified places ; so that, in contempt of the emperor, the Romans seemed to be Yiterbians, and the Yiterbians to be Romans. Upon hearing this, the emperor, much nettled, went in great haste, with an innumerable armed company, and attempted to fill the trenches with tuns, tui\*\^ blocks of wood, and heaps of earth, that, forcing an entry, he might immediately massacre all the inhabitants. But the citizens from above, seeing what was going forward, repulsed vigorously from the interior the attempts of the enemies ; and on the outside, the Romans, coming in immense numbers, mightily rendered ftitile the projects of the emperor ; and an affi\^y taking place, many fell\* on the emperor\'s side. One illustrious soldier on the emperor\'s side, and adorned with his special arms, miserably expired, to the great grief of the emperor, being pierced by a shaft from a cross-bow ; and his enemies, exulting in his fall, raised a shout of joy, thinking they had killed the emperor himself; but the

But those who inhabited the surrounding parts, seeing that the emperor had basely retired, with great loss of men and property and with disgrace, many of them departed from their aJlegiance to him, and leagued themselves with the Bomans and Yiterbians, according as the poet says, --- Mobile Diutatur semper cam principe mlgas. \[The fickle mob change ever with the prin\^.\] The emperor\'s fame is obscured. The emperor\'s renown was upon this not a little diminished ; for Count Simon of Tuscany, to whom he had intrusted in full confidence the charge of Viterbo, had been taken with his colleagues, as has been before stated, and led captive to Bome. The city of Viterbo itself, besides certain towns and castles in the neighbourhood, had been lost, and the emperor himself had almost taken flight. His reputation was blasted, and it was whispered about that he never deigned to attend divine worship, that he never prayed, or respectfully treated ecclesiastics ; that he never properly observed the Catholic faith either in his words or opinions ; that he was on improper terms of intimacy with Saracen women ; and that he invited Saracens, as well as other infidels, within his empire, and permitted them to build fortified cities. Many nobles leave the emperor. Therefore many wise and powerful nobles left the emperor ; viz., the Marquis de Montferrat, the Marquis de Malaspina, Yercelli, Alessandria, and many noble cities ; so his enemies multiplied, because men are accustomed to follow only fortime\*s £a.vourites. In Crermany, too, many abandoned his cause, and not wishing longer to be his Uege subjects, cliose for themselves another king, or emperor, namely the landgrave, a brave and well-fevoured man, to whom Germany, and the most powerful part of Italy, promised both aid and counsel, unwearying, even to exposing their lives in his service.

But the emperor, reflecting over these dangers with a thoughtfal mind, intrusted the conduct of his army to one of his most intimate friends, and telling no one the necessity for so sudden a step, hastily turned his reins thither, and that the more confidently, because the said landgrave had not yet Ailly consented to the aforesaid election, and had not only not given them his consent, but also not given them his answer. For he was attached to the emperor, and detested the chicanery of the Eoman court. The emperor, therefore, coming to him, and summoning him amicably and secretly to a secure place, they entered mutually into discussion and friendly conversation, and before his departure they shook hands with one another, and entered into an alliance, so that, from being suspected, the same landgrave became a most trusty friend, and publicly declared to all who elected him, that he could in nowise consent to such a rash presumption. The emperor, therefore, having settled the affair perfectly to his satisfaction, returned to his army, with the same prudence with which he departed. The emperor is humiliated. But those who hated the emperor Frederick, brightened up and exulted, and greatly rejoiced at the losses which he had incurred, which above we have folly detailed and recounted. The emperor, therefore, was at that time a little humiliated, accorcfing to the word of the prophet, \" Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, O Lord.\*\' Therefore, noblemen, and persons of profound wisdom, interposed, and diligently applied themselves to re-establish peace between the Church and the emperor. But the emperor refused to swear in any way to submit himself absolutely to ecclesiastical censure, imless arguments should be heard, and the way clear before him, and all conditions explained ; or to give up any of his acquisitions, howsoever made, which regarded the ancient rights of the empire.

For, I wonder that, when so terrible an extermination threatens all Christians, such stubbornness should have imiversally seized on kings and other potentates of the earth, that you, who are said to have zeal for God, do not attempt to move the hearts of the obstinate, by the weight of your influence, seeing that many wise people would abide by your authority, and believe in your words. But expenence alone shows what great danger threatens the Christians through the invasion of the Tattars. For, touching the cruelty and cunning of that people, calumny itself could not lie ; and, in briefly informing you of their wicked habits, I will recount nothing of which I hold either a doubt or mere opinion, but what T have with certainty proved, and what I know. Having formerly been accused, as you know, by my rivals, on account of heretical depravity, in the presence of Robeii; of Curzun, the legate of the Boman court, from no scruple of conscience, but blushing at the baseness of the cause, I declined the judgment, and for this became still more an object of suspicion.

They were pleased at hearing this, and said that I was to be envied, for having suffered persecution for righteousness\* 8£kke. I was entertained there among them three months, in splendour and voluptuousness ; and every day listened in silence to the many errors --- ay, horrors--- \^which they uttered against the apostolic Mth. They so bound me to them by their kindnesses, that I promised from that time I would endeavour to persuade all Ohiistians with whom I should have serious talk, that no one could be saved by the feith of Peter, and would boldly persist in teaching this doctrine. When I had promised, on my word of honour, to do this, they began to disclose to me their secrets, and told me that from ahnost all the cities of Lombardy and some of Tuscany, they had sent apt scholars to Paris, some to study the intricaciL of logic, Ld others theological disquisitions, for the purpose of maintaining their own errors, and refuting the profession of the apostolic £dth. For the same purpose, also, they send many merchants to the markets, to pervert rich laymen, their companions at table, and their hosts, with whom they have an opportunity of conversing familiarly, and so, driving a double traffic, get into their own hands the money of others, and at the same time gather souls into the treasury of Antichrist. I at length obtained leave to depart from these apostate brethren, and was sent by them to Milan, to be there entertained by their fellow-professors. In this manner I passed through all the cities of Lombardy on the banks of the Po, always residing among the Paterinians, and always at my departure receiving an introduction to others of the same sect. I at length reached Cremona, a celebrated town in Frioli, where I drank the most noble wines of the Paterinians, ate their preserved raisins, cherries, and other exciting meat, deceived the deceivers, and professed myself a Paterinian, though I still continued to be, so help me God, in faith, though not in perfect works, a Christian. I stopped three days at Cremona, and received safe conduct from the brethren, but malediction from one of their bishops, named Peter Gallo, who held me in suspicion ; afterwards, however, as I heard, this man was deposed by them for fornication.

The next day the lay brother left me, and I remained alone. I passed alone through Carinthia, and continued my route into Austria, put up at a town called in the Teutonic tongue Neustadt, i.e. New-city, where I was hospitably entertained by some religious of a new order, called Beguins. I next concealed myself for some years at the neighbouring city of Vienna, and the adjoining districts, confounding --- alas ! that I should say so ! --- right and wrong together, for I lived incontinently, by the instigation of the devil, and was a deadly enemy to my own soul, though at the same time I recovered many from the error of the Paterinians, of which I have already spoken. In consequence of their heresy, and many other sinful things arising among us Christians, the Lord has bef\*n roused to anger, and l)ecome an angry devastator, and most fearful aven&\^r. This I say, because a fierce race of inhu\^man beings,\'whoae bw is ll;ies«neas. whose wrath is fury, the rod of Grod\'s anger, is passing through and dreadfully ravaging a wide tract of country, horribly exterminating with fire and sword everjrthing that comes in their way. In the course of this very summer, these people, who are named Tattars, left Fannonia, which they had got by surrender, and with nimiberless thousands fiercely besieged the town above named, in which I perchance was then residing. There were no soldiers on our side in the town, to oppose them, except fifty knis\^hts and twenty cross-bowmen, whom the duke had left in lirrison. Thei, mounting on some neighbouring eminences, saw the immense army that lay round them, and shuddered at the fierceness of those satellites of Antichrist. Miserable groans were now heard ascending to the Lord of the Christians, from those who had been surprised in the neighbouring province, and, without distinction of rank, fortune, sex, or age, all perished alike, by different kinds of death. The Tattar chiefs, with the houndish cannibals their followers, fed upon the flesh of their carcasses, as if they had been bread, and left nothing but bones for the vultures.

Virgins were deflowered until they died of exhaustion ; when their breasts were cut off to be kept as dainties for their chiefs, and their bodies furnished a jovial banquet to the savages. Meanwhile, those who were looking out from the top of a promontory, saw approaching the duke of Austria, the king of Bohemia\^ the patriarch of Aquileia, the duke of Carinthia, and, as was said, the marquis of Bade, with many princes of the neighbouring states, drawn up for battle. Li a moment all that execrable race vanished, all those riders returned into wretched Hungary. As suddenly as they had come, so suddenly did they disappear ; a circumstance wliich creates the greater fear in the minds of those who witnessed it. The prince of Dalmatia took prisoners eight of the fugitives, one of whom was known by the duke of Austria to be an Englishman, who, for certain crimes, had been banished for ever from the kingdom of England. This man had twice come as an envoy and interpreter from the king of the Tattars to the king of Hungary, and plainly threatened and warned them of the evils which afterwards happened, unless he should give up himself and his kingdom to be subject to the Tattars. The princes persuaded him to speak the truth about the Tattars, and he, without hesitation, under every form of oath, made his statements so strongly that the devil himself mighl have been believed. First, he told about himself, that immediately after his banishment, that is, before he was thirty years old, he lost all he had at gambHng, in the city of Acre ; and in the winter-time had nothing but a shirt of sackcloth, shoes of ox\'s skin, and a cape made of horsehair. In this shameful state of want, and in an enfeebled state of body, with his hair cropped as if he were a buffoon, and uttering inarticulate cries like a dumb man, he passed over many countries, and met with great kindness from his entertainers, wearing out his life somehow or other, though he daily,\*in the levity of his tongue and the foolishness of his heart, had wished himself at the deviL At length, from excessive toil, and continual change of air and diet, he was seized with a severe illness, among the Chaldees,

Not able to go farther, or to come back, he stopped where he was, breathing with difficulty, and, being somewhat acquainted with letters, he began to put down in writing the words which were there spoken, and afterwards pronounced them so correctly that he was taken for a native, and he learnt several languages with the same facility. The Tattars heard of him through their spies, and drew him over to their interests : when they had got an answer about their claim of subjugating the whole world, they bound him to be loyal in their service, by bestowing on him many gifts ; for they were in much need of persons to be their interpreters. Concerning their manners and their superstitions, the disposition and dimensions of their persons, their country, and mode of fighting, he swore that they are greedy, passionate, deceitful, and merciless beyond all other men. The vigour and ferocity of the punishments which were inflicted on them by their chiefs, is that which restrains them from quarrels, or £rom mutually cheating and injuring one another. The founders of their tribes are called gods, and they celebrate their solemnities at certain seasons ; they have many especial celebrations, but only four regular ones. They think that everything was made for them alone, and they think that there is no cruelty in practising every kind of severity on those who rebel against them. They have hard and robust breasts, lean and pale £ftces, stiff high shoulders, and short distorted noses ; their chins are sharp and prominent, the upper jaw low and deep, the teeth long and few, their eyebrows stretch from the hair to the nose, their eyes are black and restless, their countenances long and grim, their extremities bony and nervous, their legs thick but short below the knee. In stature they are equal to us, for what they lose below the knee is made up for in the greater length of their upper parts. Their native country is that great waste, formerly a desfert, lying beyond the Chaldees, from which they expelled the lions, bears, and other beasts, with their bows and other warlike weapons. Out of the tanned hides of these animals, they made for themselves armour of a light description, but impenetrable. They have horses, not large, but very strong, and that require Uttle food, and they bind themselves firmly on their backs. They use darts, clubs, battle-axes, and swords in battle, and fight bravely

Their back armour is thin, that they may not be tempted to run away ; and they never retreat from battle until they see the chief standard of their leader retreating. When vanquished, they never ask for mercy, and themselves never spare the vanquished. In the intention and fixed purpose of reducing all the world Under their dominion, they all pei\^sist, as one man ; nor yet can they be reckoned at a thousand thousand.\* Their satellites, in number six hundred thousand, are sent forward to prepare quarters for the army, on fleet horses, and perform three days\' journey in one night. They suddenly disperse themselves over a whole province, and falling on the inhabitants, imarmed, undefended, and scattered, they make such havoc, that the king or prince of the beleaguered country cannot muster men to bring into the field against them. In time of peace they deceive the people and the princes of the countries, on reasons which are no reasons. At one time they say they left their country to bring back the sacred bodies of the magi kings, which adorn the city of Cologne ; at another time they say it was to check the avarice and pride of the Romans, who oppressed them of old ; another reason was, only to subdue under their dominion the barbarous Hyperborean nations and tribes ; then they said it was their intention to temper the fury of the Teutonics with their own moderation ; now it was to learn warfare from the French ; now to gain a sufficiency of fertile land on which to maintain their multitudes ; and, lastly, they said it was to terminate their pilgrimage at St. James\'s, in Crallicia. By these fictions, they prevailed on some simple kings to make a treaty with them, and grant them a free passage through their territories ; the Tattars did not keep the treaty, and those princes perished all the same. Seeing, then, that such dangers are arising to the whole of Christendom, what are these holy brothers doing, with their new religious rites, and fresh from the fire of the furnace out of which they have been fashioned, who wish it to be believed that they alone have found out the way of perfection beyond \* Nee po89unt tamen millia millium compatari.

Wherefore this strife, blown abroad through all parts, far and wide, because in all Christendom there are none of superior rank, ay, none of such high rank, exhilarated the hearts of the Tartars, ay, and of all pagans, and, moreover, of all the enemies of Christ, and made them increase their hopes.

Meanwhile, the emperor, seeing that the newly-created pope had confirmed the sentence of his predecessor, and did not wish to regard him in any way, refused, on his part, to submit absolutely to the mandates of the Church, and gave orders that the roads, ports, and bridges should be most strictly guarded, that no one carrying money, for which he knew the Eoman court had an insatiable thirst, might pass by. His son Conrad diligently applied himself to this work, and stopj\^ed with such vigilance the roads, both by sea and land, for all travellers, that he spared not the fraternity of Minorites, or Pi\^achers, or any one disguised, whom he could seize, but tortured whom he caught till they died. Increase of the Beguins. At the same time, chiefly in Germany, certain persons of both sexes, but principally women, declaring themselves religionists, took a religious habit, though not a very heavy one, and made profession of continence and simplicity of life by a private vow, without, however, being straitened by the rules of any saint, nor as yet shut up within the precincts of any cloister. In short, their number was increased to such an extent, that in the city of Cologne and neighbourhood, two thousand of them were found. « Controversy between the Minorite brothers and Preachers, And that the world might not appear to be devoid of increasing troubles on every side, a controversy arose between the Minorite brothers and Preachers, to the astonishment ot many, because they seemed to have chosen perfection\'s path, viz. that of poverty and patience. On one side the Preachers declaring that they were instituted first, and on that account more worthy ; that they were also more decent in their apparel, and had deservedly obtained their name and office from their preaching, and that they were more truly distinguished by the apostolic dignity : on the other side, the Minorites gave answer, that they had embraced, for God, a way of living more rigorous and humble, and so the more worthy, because

A.D. 1243.\] THE MINORITES AND PREACHERS. 475 inore holy ; and that the brothers could and certainly ought to pass over from the order of Preachers to their order, as from an inferior community to one more rigorous and superior. The Preachers conti\^cted them to their face, saying, that though the Minorites went barefoot, coarsely clad, and girded with a rope, the privilege of eating flesh or a more delicate article of diet was not denied them even in public, a thing which is forbidden to the community of Preachers, wherefore it could not be allowed that the Preachers could enter the order of Minorites, as one more rigorous and more worthy, but quite the contrary. Therefore, between these, even as between the Templars and Hospitallers, in the Holy Land, through the enemy to the human race sowing the seeds of dissension, a great and scandalous strife arose ; and inasmuch as it was between learned men and scholars, it was more dangerous to the Catholic church, and a sign of a great judgment impending at its threshold. And what is terrible, and a sad presage, for three or four hundred years, or more, the monastic order did not hasten to destruction so quickly as their order, of whom, now, the brothers, twentyfour years having scarcely elapsed, had first built, in England, dwellings which rivalled regal palaces in height. These are they who daily expose to view their inestimable treasures, in enlarging their sumptuous edifices, and erecting lofty walls, thereby impudently transgressing the limits of their original poverty, and violating the basis of their religion, according to the prophecy ot the German Hildegarde. When noblemen and rich men are at the point of death, whom they know to be possessed of great riches, they, in their love of gain, diligently urge them, to the injury and loss of the ordinary pastors, and extort confessions and hidden wills, lauding themselves and their own order only, and placing themselves before all others. So no faithful man now believes he can be saved, except he is directed by the counsels of the Preachers and Minorites. Desirous of obtaining privileges in the courts of kings and potentates, they act the parts of councillors, chamberlains, treasurers, bridegrooms, and mediators for marriages ; they are the executors of the papal extortions ; in their sermons, they either are flatterers, or most cutting reprovers, revealers of confessions, or imprudent accusers. Despising, also, the authentic orders which were instituted by the holy

476 ICATTHEW PARIS. \[a.d. 1243. fathers, namely, by St. Benedict and St. Augustine, and also the followers of them (as the thing clearly appears in the case of the church of Scarborough, when the Minorites shamefully retreated), they set their own community before the rest. They look upon the Cistercian monks as clownish, harmless, half-bred, or rather ill-bred, priests ; and the monks of the Black order as proud epicures. The university of Parie reproves their errors. Also, at that time, namely after the feast of St. Michael, the usual re-assembling of the schools and scholars having taken place, the masters of theology, especially the chief readers of the Preachers and Minorites, began to dispute and discuss more minutely and deeply than was proper or advantageous. Hesitating not to scale mountains, where the glory of God might confound them, they ventured rashly to scrutinize the unsearchable secrets of the Almighty, and presumptuously to investigate his judgments, which are a great deep. They were, consequently, unequal to the task, scrutinizing thus deeply, and wandered where there was no path, by the vengeance of God, who is more pleased with the sober simplicity of a steady faith, than with the most transcendent skill in theology. And though it is safer and more meritorious simply to accept and believe the traditions we have received from the fathers, than to try and prove them by those means which human reason affords, they chose rather to puff themselveo and to rise above their proper level. But when the prelates of the churches learnt these things, watching for the welfare of the Church and the Christian faith, rested on the authority of the Evangelists and prophets for curbing their rash audacity, and having convoked a meeting of orthodox people, wisely declared the truth of the faith. Their first error was, that the Divine essence neither is seen, nor will be seen, by man in a state of purity, or by an angel. To this the prelates answered : We con\^ demn this error, and excommunicate those who declare and uphold it ; for we firmly beUeve and assert, that God in his essence, or substance, or nature, will be seen by the holy angels, and by man, when in a state of gloiy. Another error was, that although the Divine essence is the same in the

But, in order that no prospeiity in this world should be unmixed with adversity, before the coantess embarked at Dover, bearers of monniful news came to her, announcing that her husband Baymond, the count of Provence, was struck with a mortal disease, and only waiting for a tomb, he who had afforded the Koman church, in all her troubles, an efficacious aid by working injury to the emperor. When the king was made acquainted with this, he fell into an inconsolable grie\^ and invoked the mercy of God for the count, by prayers and charitable gifts to the extent of his capability. The new pope sends a new person into England to extort money. About the same time, the newly-elected pope sent a new extortioner of money into England, namely Master Martin, carrying a letter of authority from the pope, and empowered to excommunicate, suspend, and in many ways to punish those who opposed his wishes. Strengthened with which power, he suspended the English prelates, so that they could not derive any benefit from their benefices till they had satisfied the cravings of the pope, who extorted their revenues for his clerks or relations. But he deemed it unworthy to receive any sum unless it amounted to thirty marks or more, lest so great a man might seem to be careful about trifles. The said Master Martin therefore began imperiously to demand o\^ and extort from, prelates, and especially the religious, gifts, chiefly magniflcent palfreys, strictly enjoining in his letters such an abbat or such a prior to send him horses as would be fit for a special clerk of the pope to ride on. Those who opposed and made excuses, and put forth causes for non-compliance, even reasonable causes (as, for example, the abbat of Malmesbury and the prior of Merfcon), were suspended and heavily punished to his fiill satisfaction. For this careful inquisitor turned his eyes upon all the vacant churches and prebendal stalls, that he might with them supply the open demands of the papal wants. Among others, a rich prebend in the church of Salisbury, connected with the precentor, fell vacant, and this man, in spite of the bishop and all his chapter, laid hands upon the same, and by the pope\'s commands, gave it to one of his own nephews, a mere

Unjust conduct of the king towards the bishop qf Winchester. Also, at that same time, the king improperly oppressed with a heavy hand the bishop of Winchester. He had never deigned to admit him to an amicable conference, or to the kiss of peace and friendship, when, at his return from trans\^ marine parts, the said bishop graciously presented himself ; he pursued him with inexorable hatred, and did not permit any layman to live with him, to wait upon him, and would not suffer him to receive hospitality in any house, but looked upon those who received and consoled him, as public enemies. He also cruelly hindered from reaching the bishop a ship and chariots laden with provisions, coming from Norwich. The said bishop journeying to London, did not dare to enter his palace at Southwark, on accoxmt of the shameful opposition he received from the king\'s satellites. He was hospitably concealed in the house of the canons of Southwark, which is near his palace \*and in his see, and there humbly waited for a change in the adverse times, and till prosperity from above shoiild visit him. But the king, acting upon the advice of iniquitous men, prohibited every one in the city of London from selling him even the necessaries of life, which we do not recollect was inflicted on St. Thomas of Canterbury ; the bishop then, grieving xmder his manifold injuries and troubles, complained, with good cause, to his fellow-bishops, which having learnt, the bishops of Lincoln, Worcester, and Hereford, moved by piety, and inflamed with zeal for justice, hastened to Reading, that they might rebuke the king and advise him to correct his faults. But the king, informed of their coming, fled, declining their salutary admonitions ; but when at length they found him, he broke out into words of excuse and hatred, and was by no means softened by their exhortations ; but manifestly on the contrary, he sent, to the bishop\'s detiiment, Theobald de Hurley and Master Henry de Susa to the Boman court, with a large treasure, which he exhorted them to spend, and to promise a much richer one to the pope and the Boman court,

For the abovenamed prior, knowing this for certain, prudently returned ; but his colleague Henry wickedly and seditiously carried away the king\'s treasure, and journeying to his native parts, after the example of the raven, which did not return to the ark, did not reappear in England. Death of Cardinal John qf Cfohnna. At the same time of the year, namely the octaves of the Purificatiop of the Blessed Virgin, died John of Colonna, a Koman cardinal, a vessel of all kinds of pride and insolence ; who, as he was the most illustrious and powerful in secular possessions of all the cardinals, was the most efficacious author and fosterer of discord between the emperor and the pope. Master Roger is confirmed bishop of Bath, At the same time. Master Roger, precentor of Salisbury, was confirmed in the bishopric of Bath --- \^the more readily, seeing that there was his prebend at Salisbury to be given to the pope\'s nephew. At the same time, a monk named Thomas of Gloucester, having been regularly elected, from the bosom of the Church, was lawfully created abbat of Evesham.

The Normans are deprived of their English possessions. In the course of those days, the king of France having convoked, at Paris, all the people across the water who had possessions in England thus addressed them : \'\^ As it is im\> possible that any man living in my kingdom, and having possessions in England, can competently serve two masters, he must either inseparably attach himself to me or to the king of England.\" Wherefore those who had possessions and VOL.

Which, when it came to the knowledge of the king of England, he ordered that all people of the French nation, and especially Normans, who had possessions in England, should be disseised of them. Whence it appeared to the king of France that the king of England had broken the treaties concluded between them, because he had not, as the king of France had done, given the option to those who were to lose their lands in one or other of the two kingdoms, so that they might themselves choose which kingdom they would remain in. But as he was much weakened in body since his return from Poitou, he did not wish to renew the war, and preferred to keep silence ; he even sought to repress the impetuous complaints of the Normans, as well as the furious and greedy desire that they manifested to rise against the king of England, Letter on the state qf the Holy Land, About the same time a most agreeable rumour pervaded Christian climes, which was confirmed by the following letter : --- \" Brother Hermann, qf Ferigord, the hvmble minister qf tlie poor soldiery of the Temple, to his dear brother in Christ Mohert ofSandford, preceptor in England, greeting in the Lord. --- Since we are bound to inform your fraternity, with letters or messengers concerning the state of the Holy Land, as often as an opportunity presents itself, you must know that the sultan of Babylon, after the ills which he received from us ; and Nasser, who was then the furtherer of his designs, his coadjutor and the persecutor of Christians, whom we did not cease to attack, according to our forces, have been at last coml)elled, though unwilling, to confer with us, and re-establish the truce, and promise to restore to the Christians all the land on this side the Jordan ; we therefore thought fit to send on this occasion to the presence of the said sultan, in Babylon, deputies, noble and discreet men of our brethren. Whom having guarded and retained for half a year and more, he cut off Gaza, St. Abraham, Neapolis, Varan, and others, from those which he had before promised us ; and this proceeding being iniurious to us, he then gave us nothing but words of deception and emptiness.

We having prudently deliberated with regard to this affair, having had the needful advice of the prelates, and of some of the barons of the country, have properly refused the truce ot the said sultan, and have thought proper to treat with the sultan of Damascus, and with Nazar, the lord of Crach, so that they have given up to Christian culture all the land on this side of the river Jordan, except St. Abraham, Neapolis, and Bossan. Wherefore angels and men should rejoice, that the holy city Jerusalem is now inliabited by Christian people, all the Saracens being driven out, and that in all those holy places, in which for fiffcy-six years the name of God had not been called on, the bishops of the Church having now reconciled and purified them, the divine mysteries are daily celebrated ; for which God be praised. To visit which places the road lies open, free, and secure to all. Nor is it doubtful but it might remain in this happy and prosperous state for a veiy long time, if in these times the Christians alone on this side the sesi, from this moment would be of one mind and of one heart. But, alas ! how many are there who through hatred and envy are contrary with us, and troublesome to us, in these and other affairs which tend to the aggrandizement of the Holy Land. Wherefore we alone, with our convent and the prelates of the churches, together with a few of the barons of the land, who afford us all the assistance in their power, carry on our shoulders the burden of defending the land. We have wished to possess the entrance to the country where it touches on the land of Babylon and on the land of Jerusalem, that is to say, towards Gaza. In this we have been aided by the sultan of Damascus and by Nazar, lord of Crach, not without great peril and fatigue to our persons, great expense of money, and long and prudent forethought, which we have given to this business. And yet we fear that God will take heavy vengeance, by punishing those 2i2 j

Mortover, as a guard and safety for our land, we propose to erect, near Jerusalem, above Thoron, an exceedingly i\^rong castle (if we can succeed in procuring the aid of courageous men), by which it is hoped that all the land will be the more eadily retained, and for ever defended from enemies. But these things which we possess, we are by no means in a position to possess and powerfully to defend for a long time, against the sultan, who is a most potent and crafby man, unlets Christ and his faithful followers afford us effectual support.\' The truth of the preceding letter is called in question. When these things came to the hearing of many Christians, they scarcely credited either the words or the writings, as much on account of the bad reputation of the Templars as of that of the Hospitallers. Because, it is said, they always made strife between the Christians and the Saracens, so that, during the war, they might obtain money from pilgrims coming from all parts ; also on acxiount of their mutual discord, and also because they had in view to seize the person of the emperor. Moreover, the Templars in Christendom have nine thousand manors, but the Hospitallers nineteen, besides the emolimients and various revenues arising from their brotherhoods, and from procurations, all of which are increased by their privileges. And of these, every manor can furnish, without grievance, one soldier, well armed and fully equipped, for the succour of the Holy Land, even with all things which appertain to the Ml equipment of a soldier. Whence the Christians, reflecting on these things, always suppose them to conceal some fraud, and that they have some wolfish treacheries under a sheep\'s clothing. For if there had not been treachery and fraud, so many brave western knights might forcibly have penetrated the array of all the orientals, and put them to utter rout. Reformation of the Preacher and Minorite orders, on the model i\^f the Benedictines, At the same time, the brothers, chiefly the Preachers, ignorant of the rules of their order, were convicted of most impudently departing from the discipline of St. Benedict, as we have shown in this work a few chapters before, and

In the rule of St. Benedict, also, it is ordered that those who are just on the point of conversion shall not find their entrance upon it too easy ; but, as the apostle teaches, that it may be tried whether the spirit be from God, and that the harshnesses and roughnesses, through which lies the way to heaven, may be ftdly set forth. Afterwards, in the same rule, it is added, he should be told. There is the law, under which you are to carry on the spiritual warfare ; if you are able to keep to it, enter in : but if not, return as freely as you came. Furthermore, Pope Gregory, our predecessor, of happy memory, laid down a law that novices, under probation, before they take the habit of rehgion, usually given to those who make profession, or before they have delivered their profession, may, if they please, within the year, return to their former way of life. Again, wholly to remove all doubt on this subject, whereas in some religious houses the habit of novices is not distinguished from the habit of the professor, that the garments given to those who make profession, shall be blessed at the time of profession, that a distinction may be made between those oC the novices and those of the professed.

About the same time, the bishops of Lincoln, \"Worcester, and Hereford, following the king, who seemed to shun them, and, at last, finding him at Westminster, rebuked him sharply for the persecution and tyranny, which he did not cease to practise daily towards their brother and fellow-bishop of Winchester. Whilst they added entreaty to entreaty, threat to threat, and were ready to place his chapel under an interdict, the king asked delay, that he might answer them upon the subject more precisely, until Ids messengers, who had crossed the Alps, should return. For he hoped, without the least doubt, that they would corrupt the papal court, and put into execution everything on which they had set their minds. The bishops above named readily complied with the king\'s request. But when the bishop of Winchester saw their lukewarmness, he took flight privately, on the 20th of March, and went on board ship, at London, in order to cross over to France. Sailing down the Thames, he put out a short distance to sea, and arrived at the port of St. Valerie, before news of it could be carried to the king, or to any of his familiara Thence removing to Abbeville, he was met by a stately messenger from the king of France, who received the said bishop on the part of his master, the king, with joy and gladness of countenance, promising him in all things the king\'s advice and help, with every consolation and protection. He gave orders, also, from his master, that the mayor o£ Abbeville should hold all the commons of the city ready to defend the said bishop, if by chance any from the king of England should follow to do him harm ; so that, if need should require, they might fly to arms, and fight manfully against all comers, in his defence.

Though his wife had received permission to visit him, yet he was deeply affected by the tedious and unaccustomed long imprisonment, and meditated much how he could escape from the place of his confinement. One night, then, having deceived his gaolers, and made a cord out of his sheets, tapestries, and table-cloths, he let himself down perpendicularly by means of the same rope from the top of the Tower. And when he had thus descended some distance, from the weight of his body, the cord snapped, and he fell from a grieat height ; for he was a big man, and very corpulent ; and in this way he broke his neck, and died; and his pitiable corpse was found in the morning near the wall of the Tower, and afforded a lamentable spectacle to all who saw it, as his head, together with his neck, was almost buried in his breast between the shoulders. When the king heard of it, he scolded and pxmished the guards for their negligence, and ordered that the son of the said Griffin, who had been incarcerated with his father, should be forthwith more narrowly guarded. The said Griffin, who fell from the Tower, as has been stated, died on the 1st of March. Unpopularity qf the king of England on account of the bishop of Winchester\'s exile. When the bishop of Winchester was exiled, the fame of the king of England was much lessened, throughout all countries on this side of the Alps ; for the French, who were the rivals of the English, making that a pretext for their scandal, said, --- \" Look you there, at the king of England, idle and negligent with regard to all the enemies of the kingdom, he persecutes and proscribes all his holy bishops. And as formerly there was St. Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, afterwards St. Thomas the Martyr, and now of later years, the glorious Confessor Edmund, so now there is that pious man the bishop of Winchester, who for a long time faithfully served him, and was most friendly with him, whom now he will not permit to be in the security of peace, and whom he has shameftilly driven from the boundaries of his kingdom, following him in a most hostile manner.\" Which when it became faiown to Boniface, elected bishop of Canterbury, from his innate kind-heartedness, and grieving for the king\^s unpopidarity, he wrote most amicably to the

An immense army was therefore sent, and the emperor, not without great outlay of money and danger, freed the abovenamed kingdom from the inhuman Tartars, and powerfully and ably drove them beyond the limits of that kingdom. There were some who said that those detested Tartars came there from the first by the cunning machinations of the emperor ; that they only awaited his bidding, and were bound to fulfil his commands, acting in such a way that the emperor might reduce that king and his kingdom under his own dominion. But this is what was whispered by those who were jealous of him, and such calumny ought not to be believedL When the kingdom of Hungary, therefore, was freed, and its king restored in peace, Hungary became subject to the empire, and was bound to supply three hundred knights, and their followers, to fight on the borders for the emperor, loyally and Mthfiilly.

At the same time the emperor of Constantinople, fleeing from the persecutions of the Greeks, and having nothing in his treasury to enable him to protract the war any further, or bear up against the continual assaidts of the Greeks, fled to the court of the Eoman emperor Frederick for advice and assistance. The emperor, one while by launching terrible threats against the Greeks, and again by more prudent negotiation, at length obtained for him a truce for a year. The same emperor Frederick also brought to pass a marriage between his own daughter and a great chieftain of the Greeks named Battacius. This caused great annoyance and ofience to our lord the pope and the whole Boman couit,

Wherefore the Koman church calls him a schismatic ; and a more obstinate hatred than ever arose between our lord the pope and the emperor Frederick. The Tartars disperse towards the east. Meanwhile the Tartars, being hunted about, and unable to sustain any longer the emperor\'s attacks, left the northern parts, and journeyed quickly eastward. While they were savagely ravaging some parts of Persia\^ certain extremely cruel and inhuman men who dwell on the confines of the Bed Sea, and who are for the most part subject to the sultan of Babylon, and called Choermians, fled from the threatening storm, by avoiding the irruptions of the Tartars ; and they went to the sultan of Babylon, and demanded hastily and insolently a place wherein to dwell. When the sultan found out that if he should arrogantly deny their requests, they would forcibly take what they wanted at the edge of the sword, he said to them : \" At no great distance from this place there are some people whom we call Christians, they inhabit maritime places, they scorn our laws, and are troublesome and annoying to us, and threaten to become still more so ; their most important place of resort is Jerusalem.

These lightnings have opened the clouds of heaven, not for dew or a tender shower, but for a deluge of calamities upon us. For while love and what was due to faith animated the Christians who had survived the massacre made by the Choermians, to take vengeance for such a devastation and such a great disaster, at the very moment when the counsels of the leaders, and the wishes of every private soldier aspired to do something in reparation of that misfortune, the patriarch of Jerusalem, hoping for himself to obtain all the glory of the victory, and looking on every other prince and sharer therein as unworthy to be associated with himself, began to preach the crusade of the Lord, aroused the spirits of those who heard him, and inflamed them with courage bordering even upon rashness ; so that without waiting for a favourable moment, that most important rule in war, on the Monday before the feast of St. Luke the Evangelist, the Christian army, composed of all kinds of foreign chivalry, threw themselves upon the abovenamed Choermians, who had foreseen the attack, and were prepared for resistance ; and thus, in this ill-omened battle, hardly any out of all the Christians escaped fi\'om either being slain or made prisoners. Others, but very few, thanks to the means of deliverance which they met with in their flight, were saved, mostly those who had not been precipitated by their rashness into the very centre of the battle, where was the clang of arms and the thunder of the clashing combatants.

Men, famous as the bishop of St. George and the lord of Cayphas, fell OD the field of battle mortally wounded. Walter, count of Joppa, was mortally wounded ; but the archbishop of Tyre, who did not die j&x)m his wounds, was cast into prison. All these things om\* serenity has learned from letters which have been sent to us from the convent-house of St. Mary of the Teutonics. This lamentable idsue of things furnishes in itself a cause of sorrow, to draw bitterness of heart from us, and from aU the princes of the Christian faith, and worthy of a very deluge of tears from our eyes, on account of the nature of the misfortune, since so great a £Eiult preceded, and so much neglect has followed. For besides the efiervescence of the religious pride of the Templars, nourished on jhe delicacies of the aboriginal barons of the land, they have, by an imjust and imprudent war, compelled the sultan of Babylon to call in the assistance of the Choermians, in utter contempt for our royal treaty, which, with the convent and masters of the houses of St. John and the Teutonic knights of St. Mary, we had contracted with that sultan, seeing that the aforesaid therein displayed the childish simplicity of evident lolly, when they reposed confidence in the vacillation of the barbarians, and expecting to find faith in perfidy, using dishonest artifices, they united the sultans of Damascus and Orach, not only difierent in faith, but discordant in interests also with them, to help them against the army of the Choermians and the sultan, as if one should send for a quantity of oil to put out the filry ot a raging fire. So that, as we have heard clearly stated to us by some religious men, who came from foreign parts, the Templars received the aforesaid sultans and their followers within the precincts of their houses of the Temple, with joy and festivity, and suffered them to. perform there their superstitious rites and secular pomps, with invocation of the name of Mahomet. In no respect, however, could those who had been invited be turned away by kindness from their nature, nor were they deterred by the promise of alliance which they had sworn, from following their inimical tendency ; nay, they showed too plainly that it was a perjuration rather than a conjuration which they

The sultan of Camel, whom the sultan of Damaflcus had sent to help those that had made the confederacy against the sultan of Babylon, and who could have no hopes of good at the hands of the sultan of Babylon, took to flight and escaped from the battle with only five of his men ; but all the rest, after a short conflict, making a mere show of fighting, went over in safety with all their men to the sultan of Orach, with no contest at all, not even the semblance of a contest, thus ranging their persons on the side of those whose cause they had already espoused in their hearts. Moreover, the most abandoned negligence, which is the last step to destruction, when one\'s safety is at stake, augments all danger, and threatens us with swift destruction. The chiefe of the orthodox law, a thing which we, who are so wholly orthodox, cannot write without great pain, are for from thinking about reparation for such a deplorable disaster, far from groaning, afber the manner of our ancestors, for such afflicting events ; but as if the affair were not the affair of Christians or of the Christian faith, we disregard our wounds, and do not trouble about remedies. The Lord has chastened us, and we do not complain ; we are surrounded on every side by our burning roofs, yet we run not for water, but each one glories in the misfortunes of the other. In one place the fresh cruelty of the Tartars astounds us ; in another place, the ancient peevishness of a barbarous nation bums and torments us. Then, elsewhere, the shameful perfidy of the Paterinians annoys us, and above all, their peAdy, who weakening the sacred empire in Italy by their rebellions, hinder us from subjecting barbarous nations to the Christian empire, according as the Catholic church demands in her holy rites. Thus we are driven about on every side by public enemies, or tormented by hidden ones. Satan is continually working and watching, while Simon is sleeping, and we are not tolerated there, where sleep would refresh our eyes, and repose would refresh our hearts. Rouse ye, therefore, brave man, seize your arms and your buckler, to avenge the injury of our times. It is a list that we have never avoided. Grod is our witness, and we have always more freely offered our aid to the assistance ot the Holy Land, than asked help from others.

Moreover, we offered our person, or that of our son, or that of any other leader, whom those persons might think a proper one ; promising that the army should be accompanied by a thousand stipendiary knights, who should be continually in our pay, to assist in so good a thing ; and we sent, upon this, B\^rard, archbishop of Palermo, the bishops of Reggio and of Florence, as well as G. of Suessa\^ our beloved adherents, to Gregory, then sovereign pontiff as special deputies from our excellence, asking from him nothing more than to protect, by an honest and due guard, us, our sons, our empire, and our kingdoms, so that the obstinate insolence of our rebellious Lombards might at last be brought to recognise, as they are bound to do, the rights and sovereignty which belong to the Boman empire, and that the abovenamed rebels, seeing their confederation, or rather their conspiracy, destroyed, might consent to pay us our revenues, as our other subjects do, and as all other states pay to their lawful kings and masters. Then, having considered the circumstances and the affidrs of the times, we foresaw and dreaded what has recently happened (although the knowledge of what is to come is revised and unknown to mortals), as the wickedness of the times had taken such an extension, that for the ruin of Italy the sovereign pontiff of the Church suffered the concurrence of the pontificate to augment the number of our enemies. Gregory, the sovereign pontiff being dead, the papal authority having been weakened by the dissensions of this time, and he who now governs, having been placed on the apex of the pontificate, we made him, by our deputies, propositions much longer than before, and which no one would ever have thought right to have been refused ; namely, that, trusting in the omnipotence of our Lord Jesus Christ, the victorious king, we engaged to charge our shoulders with a heavy burthen, loading ourselves with all the affair across the sea, moreover, with the threatening storm of the Tartars, and the perils of the empire ot Constantinople ; according as our magnificence\'s former envoy instructed you and the other kings and princes.

Afber they had been some time engaged in that undertaking, the patriarch of Jerusalem landed from the transmarine provinces ; and, after taking some slight bodily rest, he was inspired with a longing to visit the sepulchre of our Lord, and set out on that pilgrimage, in which we also accompanied him. After our vow of pilgrimage was fulfilled, we heard in the holy city that a countless multitude of that barbarous and per\^ verse race, called Choermians, had, at the summons and order of the sultan of Babylon, occupied the whole sur&ce of the country in the furthest part of our territories adjoining Jerusalem, and had put every living soul to death by fire and sword. A council was on this held by the Christians living at Jerusalem, and, as they had not the power to resist these people, it was prudently arranged that all the inhabitants of the holy city, of both sexes and of every age, should proceed, under escort of a battalion of our knights, to Joppa\^ as a place of safety and refuge. On that same night, i\^r finishing our deliberations, we led the people cautiously out of the city, and had proceeded confidently half the distance, when, owing to the intervention of our old and wily enemy the devil, a most destructive obstacle presented itself to us ; for the aforesaid people raised on the walls of the city some standards, which they found left behind by the fugitives, in order by these means to recall the unwary, by giving them to believe that the Christians who had remained had deteated their adversaries. Some of our fellow-Christians hurried afber us to recall us, comforting us with pleased countenance, and declaring that the standards of the Christians, whidi they well knew, were raised on the walls of Jerusalem, in token that they had defeated the enemy ; and they, having been thus deceived, deceived us also. We, therefore, in our exultation, returned confidently into the holy city, thinking to dwell there safely, and many from feelings of devotion, and others in hopes of obtaining and retaining possession of their inheritances, rashly and incautiously returned, either into the dty itself or into the suburbs ; we, however, endeavoured to dissuade them from this altogether, fearing treachery from these perfidious people, and so went away from them.

Hiey therefore left the city by night, and wandered about in the trackless and desert parts of the moimtains, till they at length came to a narrow pass, and there they fell into an ambuscade of the enemy, who, surrounding them on all sides, attacked them with swords, arrows, stones, and other weapons, slew and cut to pieces, according to a correct computation, about seven thousand men and women, and caused such a massacre, that the blood of those of the faith, with sorrow I say it, ran down the sides of the mountains like water. Young men and virgins they hurried off with them into captivity, and retired into the holy city, where they cut the throats, as of sheep doomed to the slaughter, of the nuns, and aged and infirm men, who, unable to endure the toils of the journey and flight, had fled to the church of the Holy Sepulchre and to Calvary, a place consecrated by the blood of our Lord, thus perpetrating in his holy sanctuary such a crime as the eyes of men had never seen since the commencement of the world.

The discontent which had been long conceived, and had rankled in the hearts of the English, in consequence now broke forth in open complaints, and as if in parturition, they spoke out openly, being unable any longer to contain themselves ; for their patience was become idleness, and their humility was unproductive of a\^ vantage, indeed rather injurious, and at a council assembled the following considerations were intimated to the king and the kingdom : --- If the pope were to look with his mental eye on the condition of the primitive church in England, what it was in the middle ages and what it is now, he would not shake the foundations of the churches and the ecclesiastics, nor would he oppress them by exactions and afflictions of this kind, or claim or extort from the churches what is not his. For, by the preaching of St. Augustine, the apostle of the English, King Ethelbert was converted to the faith of Christ, and instituted the churches of London, Kochester, and Canterbury, and placing clerks and priests in one place and monks in another, he assigned to them sufficient lands and possessions for their support, and deputed to them the sole office of performing divine services in the places assigned to them, of pouring forth praise and thanksgiving to God day and night, of bestowing alms, and performing other works of piety, and of showing hospitality to the poor according to the extent of their means. In like manner also other kings made grants to other cathedral, prebendal, and conventual churches, which can be seen on inspection of their instruments and the lists of donations. They have not, however, given these possessions with liberty so absolute as not to reserve always three things to themselves for the public advantage of the kingdom ; namely, a military expedition, and the repairing and mending of the bridge and citadel, by these means to repel the attacks of enemies. If, therefore, these things are given from the patrimonies and lay fees of kings and princes to the spiritual places, and the bishops of those places as to fixed persons in cathedral churches, and to abbats and abbacies, by what right, we ask, can they, without injury to the right of

Whence are they to obtain means to show hospitality ? How will they be able to stay in the places assigned to them ? Again, besides other evils\^ which those who are going from England to the Koman court may suffer at the hands of the emperor\'s agents, one is plain and palpable enough, which is\^ that, as the territory of the emperor is only separated from England by a narrow sea, which can be crossed in one ebb and flow of the tide, and as the emperor is now going to those parts\^ it is to be feared that the emperor, being thus provoked, might invade the kingdom as an enemy, as Master W\^ter de Ocra said in the king\'s presence at a general coimcil of the barons at London, when he, on behalf of the emperor, most earnestly begged the king and barons not to allow tallies to be collected in the kingdom, either from clerks or laymen, to assist the pope against the emperor, and at the same time giving them to understand repeatedly, that if they did so, innumerable wars would arise in the kingdom, and that the king, and nobles of the kingdom, would scrape themselves to the very bones. Again, inasmuch as the king had, by the advice and at the wish and request of the Church, given his sister in marriage to the emperor, to whom she had given an ofibpring, which was plainly of our race and of Engli\^ blood, what else was it, if we contributed money against the emperor, than destroying those sprung from our own nation ? which God forbid. And what else would be the result than to prevent the emperor from assisting our king in recovering his own territories 1 Again, if ;the pope would consider the afflictions and losses which had been sustained by England at the hands of the French king, Louis, who had invaded it, and who spared neither churches nor ecclesiastics, but had pillaged ever3rthing to such an extent, that the prelates of England had scarcely been able to breathe freely heretofore, he, the pope, would not heap affliction on affliction on the afi\^cted, bu\^ proceeding on a better plan, would require a reckoning for

Again, the Church has gold, the Church has its inheritance, has cities, fortifications and castles, and though they may not be sufficient to oppose such a powerful prince, she may recall into her own hands the benefices of the Italians and Bomans\^ which she has bestowed on them, in no small numbers, as well in England as in other countries, and from the produce of those whom she has so beneficed, she may make hostile preparations. And not with our revenues, which she did not confer upon us, and which we owe to our patrons alone, who have given us all they could, and whom we ought to sustain in every want, if it should so ha{)pen that they require it. The pope, moreover, ought to reflect that, in the affliction of the Israelites, Pharaoh released the priests and Levites from every exaction of this kind. The king qf England writes to the pope, complaining qf his exactions. The king, therefore, roused by these injuries, and annoyed by the mamfold avarice of the Romans, wrote to the pope as follows ; --- \" To the most holy father in Christ and Lord, InnocerU, hy the grace of Grod. supreme pontiff, Henry, by the same grace, king of EngUmd, (kc, Health, and kisses to his blessed feet. --- The more that the son submits himself to the pleasure of his father, and the readier and more devoted he shows himself to his commands, the more deserving is he of obtaining his father\'s protection, and of reaping the advantages of his devotion and service. Inasmuch, then, as during the whole of our reign, we have shown ourselves and our kingdom obedient to your pleasiu\'e and commands in everything and through .everything, although we have in some matters connected with ourselves and our kingdom, generally found in you the anxiety and kindness of a lather, yet, in some of your decree\*\*\^ granted by you to the clerks of England and other countriet we find that ourselves and our kingdom have been burdened and oppressed in no slight degi\'ee. Indeed, the English churches are burdened with such and so many provisions of this kind, that not only are the patrons of churches, and

In the mean time, also, we entreat of your holiness, in your paternal solicitude, to protect our rights and liberties, which you can consider to be properly our owq, and not connected with others, and to preserve them inviolate and entire, and not allow them to be in any way disturbed at your court on the suggestions of any persons. And I tiiist that your holiness will not be excited to anger against us, if we have in any points opposed the tenour of your commands, since the cry of complaining parties has urged us to this, seeing that we ought not to fail in defending the rights ol any man, but, by virtue of the kingly office granted to us by God, ought to afford full justice in civil matters.\" By the same, or more clever argimients, the too patient and remiss king had formerly begged of his predecessor, Pope Gregory, to desist from oppressing the kingdom of England by such exactions ; but neither the one nor the other deigned to restrain his inclinations in this matter ; owing to which, we believe that the Lord and his apostle Peter (in whose steps they did not tread) were provoked with just cause to anger against the Roman church, and prepared and bent their bow. How the pope endeavoured to bring Wales to obedience to him, I think that it will not be foreign or irrelevant to my subject, or altogether without benefit to the history of England, to explain to our posterity how the said Pope Innocent the Fourth endeavoured to exempt David, prince of North Wales, from his allegiance to the king of England, to whom he was bound in manifold ways, and to render him subject to his own dominion, by receiving five himdred marks annually for his tenure of North Wales and its appurtenances. And the bonds and instruments by which the said David

The aforesaid David moreover, wishing to free his neck from the yoke of allegiance to the king, fled to the papal wings for protection, promising to hold that part of Wales which belonged to him from the pope himself The pope, in consequence, favoured his cause, and, what I consider a circumstance greatly to be wondered at, opened the bosom of protection and refuge to him, although rebelling against his king ; imless, perhaps, it so happened that he obtained the pope\'s assistance by suppressing the truth and by &dse statements. For what Christian can be ignorant that the prince of Wales was a petty vassal of the kuig of England ? The king prohibits the idle qfthe wool afthe Ciaterciana.

But as it would take too long to enumerate, yet we ought not, and cannot, be entirely silent on the occurrences which happen not only at the sepulchre of Edmund, of happy memory, formerly archbishop of Canterbury, whose body, that illustrious heap ot earth, rests in our church, in which he, with the highest devotion, chose his pilace of buiial, but which have now spread through the whole world by distinguished and manifest miracles. For, in various and distant places, on invoking his name, miracles are worked, not single miracles of a kind, but series of them one after another ; and these we will briefly and quickly run through, as far as they have reached our eyes and ears. Blind children are restored to sight, those lame from their birth recover the power of walking; the dropsical diminish in size ; those deaf from birth recover hearing ; the dumb from birth speak plainly ; paralytic persons are restored to strength ; those possessed by devils are freed from them ; prisons are opened, bonds are loosed ; sufferers from quartan and other fevers escape death ; some labouring under epilepsy, and various others afficted with various and hidden severe diseases, some deprived of the use of their limbs, and who have become motionless as a log of wood ; others who have become suddenly insane, others who are defiled by the disease of fistula, others polluted and disfigured by tumours, are, by the assistance of his merits, restored to their former health. The flow of blood in women is stopped ; one is cured ol jaimdice, the toothache of another is eased ; foul spots die away from one, leaving no trace whatever, the ruptured, the hump-backed, those afflicted with gravel, and piles, and otherwise seriously afflicted, are cured ; some who have fallen into pits, rivers, and deep waters, and others who have been hurled from a great height, on invoking his name have received but slight, if any, bodily injuiy ; some ensnared in the toils of apostasy,

Some who in times of adversity were spirit-broken by trouble, and who have almost sunk into the pit of despair, have, to their joy, met with consolation and relief, on recalling the name of this pious father to their memory. There are some who, overcome by divers infirmities and in cases of danger, when they have invoked the name of this worshipper of God, beloved by angels, though terrible and hatefrd to demons, have been released from all their evils, and felt the presence of the virtues of our Lord Jesus Christ. These and more miracles are worked by the only God, who is above all things blessed for ever and ever. What is a wonderful circumstance too, brute auimals also feel benefits throinrh him. Hence, by the wonderful dispensation of God, who Plains eTeiything\^ely and wholesomely, it has come to pass that in the place where his body rests, \^ch is the glory l( the miracles.

Some followers of infidelity, even, and stifi\*- necked men, who have presumed to disparage the merits of the Divine omnipotence, as well as of the said father, have been suddenly struck with conviction, and been compelled, even unwillingly, to publish these things. One circumstance more to be wondered at than others, and one unheard of at any time, occurred in the case of a certain boy who had been bom without feet, and continued so for eight years, when suddenly new feet grew ; and it is a much more imusual thing for new limbs to be substituted where there are none, than that weakened ones should be restored to strength.

For what miracle can be more glorious than that which substitutes the advantage of health for the evil of death ? and it does not seem to be without benefit that I have briefly touched on such wonderful miracles. \" For the present miracle will vouch for the truth of those past, and the expectation of future ones will be firm and unshaken ; and indeed the assemblage of the people at the said place seems more worthy of admiration than the miracles themselves, unless that circumstance be a miracle ; for what is more miraculous, what more wonderful, than that the world should to-day worship a man whom yesterday they hated 1 that to-day they should flee to him whom yesterday they fled from 1 that to-day he should be praying to God for wholesome protection for us, with whom we yesterday avoided all connection, either through fear of earthly power, or from our own evil dispositions 1 This indeed appears to some wise men to be the greatest amongst his great miracles.

Of the kind of cloak which this most blessed man used to wear, it is by no means right to be silent, for we believe it to have been a kind untried by the holy men of former times, and entirely unheard of by those of the present day. His cloak then was not made by the weaver\'s art, of fine threads, but of small ropes plaited together like a very dense net, the joints of which contained biots as innume4ble as painful, in thick order ; and that the knots might be more pressed into the flesh of the wearer, the cloak was not whole in the back part of it, but was open from the top downwards, with small meshes here and there. With these, knotted and tightly woven, he fought with himself, in order that, as the domestic torture overcame the body, he might become a martyr and obtain the victory over himself Nor was he satisfied thus to crucify the flesh with torment rather than garment ; but what he inflicted on himself in addition increased our astonishment more than all else. For in order to bind this cloak more closely to the flesh, and that it might be torn more severely by its continued pricking and rubbing, he bound it to him with a thicker rope, passed twice round him at the upper part of his body ; and this rope, passing down from his chest to his loins with many intervening coils, was tied, the extremities meeting each other below \\ and as the rope was joined to the cloak in its use, so it was of the same material. So, therefore, he had girt himself with the hair cord, who not only had girt the loins of his flesh like a dignitary of the law, with twisted flax, but like the Son of God, he was girt with a belt up to his breast.

Although he allowed biit scanty food to enter his mouth, yet it was always giving utterance to praise and thanksgiving to the Lord. He was always giving utterance to edifying words, as though they were drawn from the fount of our Lord\'s breast ; profound and edifying discourses on theology, in which he was greatly distinguished, like another Augustine, he delivered amidst sighs and groanings, with his hands and eyes always raised, like St. Martin, towards heaven, so that he invited the devotion of all when he was speakbg.

These and other proofs of the sanctity of this holy man having come to the knowledge of Nicholas, bishop of Durham, who was afflicted with incurable dropsy, discoloured by yellow jaundice, worn away to a skeleton, and who had lost all the moisture of his body, was dried up by cough and asthma, and become so black in colour that he appeared on the point of death, and nothing but the sepulchre seemed to be lefl to him, he, in this helpless state, despairing of all human remedies, had recourse, fuU of confidence, to this said holy man. He therefore vowed that, if his bodily health should be restored so as to permit him to do so, he would devoutly and with reverence visit the tomb of the blessed Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury. He was therefore conveyed in a carriage to the southern parts of England, both to benefit himself by breathing his native air, and also to be nearer to Pontigny, in order to fulfil his vow of pilgrimage. After staying there for some, he became so weak that he appeared more like an image than a man, and he therefore made his will, bade ferewell to all his friends, and received the wholesome viaticimi and extreme unction. But as he was lying at his last gasp, one W., a servant of his, who had been formerly barber and doorkeeper of St. Edmimd, when archbishop of Canterbury, and who, conceiving in his mind with good reason that G

In the matter of territory, terms have been arranged which give satisfaction to both parties, which are, that the whole territory which the Church possessed at the time of the excommunication shall be given up to it, and also with respect to those who adhered to the Church, that, in regard to his contempt of the keys, the emperor should writ\^ throughout the world in general, that, in despising the Church, and the power of the Church, he did not treat with contempt the sentence pronounced by the pope\'s predecessor. And as the aforesaid sentence was not announced to him, he proceeded by the advice of the prelates and other nobles of Germany and Italy, because he was not boimd to observe it before it was annoimced to him. Yet he professes and acknowledges, that he has failed and acted badly in this matter of non-observance of it, as he weU knows and firmly believes that the supreme pontiff has full power in spiritual matters, as well over him as over all Christians, Hngs or princes, clergy or laity, even though he himself should be a sinner, which God forbid.

With regard to the capture of the prelates : In the first place, all the property taken in their galleys, which has fallen into his, the emperor\'s, hand, or which can be found in his possession, he will restore and cause to be restored entire.

With respect to the aforesaid, and to all other injuries, losses, and offices, caused by him to churches and ecclesiastics since the quarrel commenced, and since the sentence was pronounced, and for which injuries he was excommunicated, he, the emperor, will swear strictly to abide by the commands of the pope, saving, however, to him, his rights and honours in their entirety, and without any diminution of his empire and his realms. And although we think that sufficient satisfaction has been offered for the aforesaid injuries, nevertheless, for the giving satisfaction, and for securing the performance of the preceding matters, as well as those hereinafter mentioned, the emperor will abide by the plans and decisions of the mediators, namely, Stephen, bishop of Ostia, and Giles and Otto, the cardinals, who shall, except the person of the pope, supply what they think necessary to be supplied ; on condition, however, that they, the aforesaid mediators, shall do nothing without the advice and order of the pope, and, saving the aforesaid points in the matter of satisfaction and security, they shall do whatever the pope aforesaid, by the advice of his brethren, shall determine upon. Also, with regard to those who adhered to the Church, we say that from this time, all those who adhered to the Church after the quarrel commenced, whencesoever they come, will be forgiven all injury done by them, both before and after the quarrel, whether on the Church\'s account, or on any other ; and he will revoke all bans and sentences pronounced against them. Also, that he will release them from all gifts, contracts, or bonds, which they have made to him after the sentence was pronounced, or after they adhered to the Church, and restore their possessions, rights, and honours to them entire, even though they be given to others. Concerning others, who before the dispute arose were rebels against the emperor, and were then at war with him, we say, that all their offences will be forgiven them, which they afterwards committed against him and the empire.

Concerning the security to those of Eomandiola, who adhered to the Church after the dispute arose, and to the nobles of the province of Treviso\^ and to the marquis of Montserrat, and other nobles in all parts, the emperor agrees that the aforesaid nobles shall not, unless at the provision of the pope, be bound to serve the emperor personally, but by substitutes ; and that they shall be summoned to abide the decision of their fellow- nobles and peers of the same province, those who adhered to the Church not excluded. As to those who are detained on account of real or personal actions, or even accused of criminal offences, especially in the case of the Bomagnians, the emperor, for the greater security of those who adhered to the Church, will appoint some one of the chief prelates of Italy, before whom alone they shall plead their causes, so as to give satisfaction to his holiness the pope, as well in civil as criminal cases, and this prelate shall be elected with the consent of the pope, for as long time as he may choose ; and their private places of defence the emperor shall give into the charge of those whom he may think proper ; but he shall not touch or injure the places of defence of the aforesaid, without the consent of the prelate deputed in these matters. For those belonging to the territory of Treviso, the emperor will, with the co-operation of one of the brethren whom he may think proper to select for that purpose, provide a chie\^ to whom alone those who adhered to the Church will be bound to give account of the said territory of Treviso. He will also release all the prisoners taken in the galleys, whose release is now demanded, and also all Eomans, Tuscans, and other captives taken since the sentence of excommunication was pronounced ; and will release them from all oaths and obligations by which they have bound themselves since their capture, as well those who have been liberated, as those who shall be hereafter liberated ; and for this he will give his letters patent to his faithfrd subjects, that those who are prisoners should be everywhere set at liberty by their jailers.

He therefore promised and determined, in accordance with the request of the abbat and monks of JPontigny, solemnly to canonize the blessed Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, whom he knew from public report to be shining forth with so many miracles, of which mention has been made above; and sent Andelm, archbishop of Armagh, with some other discreet and influential men, to make a due examination into these miracles. When the old and inveterate persecutors of the said saint heard this, they said amongst themselves : \" If this man is canonized and raised to the distinguished title of sanctity, we shall be put to ignominious confusion.\" They therefore, to their souls\' perdition, made a plot with Otto the legate, to prevent this saint, whom God had manifested to the world by so many miracles, from being canonized.

Yes, the rage and fury of the Tartars have now shaken the whole of the eastern region with the terrors of a manifold calamity : persecuting all alike, and making no difference between Christians and infidels, but driving off their booty from the most remote quarters, even of those who would themselves have preyed upon the Christian people. These said Tartars, after ravaging the whole of Persia, have made war in a worse spirit, and hunting out those cruel Chorosmins have dragged them forth like snakes from their holes, and driven them from their own provinces. These iatter, having no habitation, as they could not obtain a place of refuge amongst any ot the Saracens, owing to their wickednesses, were only aided by the sultan of Babylon, that persecutor of the Christian faith, who, although he refused them a place of refuge in his own territory, offered them that which belonged to others, and summoned and invited these said infidels to inhabit the land of promise which the Most High had promised and has given to those who beHeve in him. They therefore, relying on the assistance of the said sultan, came, with their wives and families, and several thousand armed knights, into the Lord\'s inheritance, which, as they said, the. sultan of Babylon had given to them ; and their arrival was so sudden that it could not be foreseen, either by us, or the neighbouring people, so as to allow us by a forewarning to guard against the coming dart, and they entered the district of Jerusalem through the provinces of Saphet and Tiberias. And although we applied all care and diligence to devise means for restoring the Holy Land to its former state of peace and tranqiullity, which was disturbed by these new enemies, yet the power of the Christians was inadequate to the task of expelling them, and the aforesaid Chorosmins then took possession of the whole country, from Toron, of the knights, which is near Jerusalem, to Gazara. We therefore, by the

The Christians\^ therefore, who were in the city, fearing the cruelty of these infidels, assembled to the number of more than six thousand men, and, trusting to the truce made by them with the sultan of Crach and the Saracens of the mountainous districts, left a few only in the city, and set out through these mountainous districts, with their families and all their property, to go into the territory of the Christians. But the Saracens of the provinces saUied out and attacked them, putting some of them mercilessly to the sword, taking away others to a hopeless captivity, and exposing the Christians of both sexes, and even nuns, for sale to the other Saracens. Some of them, however, escaping, descended into the plain of Bamah, when the Chorosmins rushed on them and committed such slaughter amongst them, that out of all this great multitude scarcely three hundred were left, and those nearly lifeless. These aforesaid perfidious wretches then entered the city of the Israelites, now almost destitute of people, and there disembowelled all the Christians who had remained there, before the very sepulchre of our Lord, into the church of which they had fled for refuge, and even decapitated the priests who were performing mass at the altars, saying among themselves, \* Here let us poiu\* forth the blood of this Christian people where they have drunk wine in

The sculptured pillars which were placed as an ornament before our Lord\'s sepulchre, they took away, and in contempt of the Christians, they sent them to the tomb of that most wicked wretch Mahomet, as a sign of victory ; and as a further insult to Christianity, they violated the tombs of the happy kings, which were placed in the same church, and scattered their bones in all directions. The revered mount of Sion they irreverently profened, and polluted with enormities unfit to relate the temple of the Lord, the church of the Valley of Jehoshaphat --- where is the tomb of the blessed Virgin, the church of Bethlehem, and the place of our Lord\'s nativity, thus exceeding the wickedness of all the other Saracens, who, although they often invaded the Christian territory, always observed some respect to those holy places. But as these said Chorosmins, not content with all this, were aiming at the capture and destruction of the whole country, the Christian people, provoked by so many injuries and enormities, and unable any longer to endure such great evils, sufficient to arouse grief and bitterness in the heart of every zealous follower of the Catholic faith, determined by conmion consent to unite the forces of the aforesaid sultans with those of the Christians, in order to resist them. Withmll these imited forces, therefore, on the fourth day of October, the Christian army began to move against them from the port of Acre, and proceeded through Csesarea and other maritime districts. The Chorosmins, then, having gained knowledge of our approach, retreated through various districts, and at length pitched their camp before Gazara, awaiting there the succours which the sultan of Babylon --- that head and chief of sacrilege --- was about to send to them. Having been joined by a large host, sent by the said sultan, when the army of the Christians and the aforesaid sultans approached them, which they did on the

y 526 MATTH£W PARIS. \[a.i\>. 1244; eve of St. Luke\'s day, we found them before Gazara with an innumerable host, and their legions drawn out in order of battle. On this our army was arranged by the chiefs in the proper order to attack the enemy, and the patriarchs and other prelates then by the authority of the omnipotent God and of the Apostolic See, absolved them of their sins, and all gave such signs of sincere contrition in abundant flowings of tears, that, regarding as nothing the death of the body\^ and hoping for eternal reward, they all thought that to die for Christ was to live. For although bodily calamity should happen to us through our sins, we must believe that the Most High, who is the searcher of hearts, and knows all secrets, would be pleased with the gain of souls rather than bodies. After this we engaged the enemy, when the Sara\^\' cens who were with us, having been overcome by the enemy, all took to flight, numbers of them being slain, or taken prisoners ; and thus the Christians were left alone in the battle. But, although the Chorosmins and Babylonians rushed on them together, the Christians being, as it were, champions of the Lord, and defenders of the Catholic faith, whom the same faith aud suffering made brothers, showed a brave resistance to them ; but at length, as they were so very few in comparison with their enemies, the tide of battle turned against them, and --- I write it with sorrow --- they yielded the victory to their enemies. Out of the whole of the brethren of the Knights of the Temple, of the Hospitallers of St. John, and of the Teutonic knights of St. Mary, only thirty-three Templars, twenty-six Hospitallers, and three of the Teutonic brethren escaped, the rest being all slain or made prisoners ; the nobles and knights of the country were for the most part slain or made prisoners, besides an immense slaughter of the cross-bowmen, and foot-soldiers. \"With respect to the archbishop of \"Tyr\^, tlie\"T)ish6p o?

And although there is no comfort amongst so many adversities and losses to us who have lost everything from the aforesaid battle, yet what we can do in the present emergency, we have done ; namely, we have sent our le;tters and messengers to the illustrious king of Cyprus, and the prince of Antioch, earnestly begging and exhorting them, in this most urgent case of necessity, to send knights and soldiera for the defence of the Holy Land ; but we do not yet know what they mean to do in the matter. We next returned to Acre, and took up our abode in that city, which we found, as well as the whole country along the coast, fiUed with grie\^ lamentation, and various and endless misery, and there was not a house or a living soul which was not lamenting for some one dead belonging to it ; but although the grief for the past was great and severe, yet fear for the future took possession of us. For as the whole country, which had been gained by the swords of the Christians, was now destitute of all human or earthly assistance and protection, and the strength of the defenders was reduced to nought and destroyed, as there were only a few surviving, and those even brought down almost to death, nothing else now seemed to remain but that all the rest should &11 into the hands of the enemies of the cross at their pleasure ; for they had now advanced to such a degree of intolerable audacity and insolence, that they pitched their camp, which extended over a space of two miles, in the plain near the city of Acre. They are also now running wild, freely, and \^dth no one to impede or oppose them, tLughl out the whole coimtry far and wide, as far as the provinces of Nazareth and Saphet, taking possession of the country\^ and dividing it amongst them as though it were their own, appointing ambassadors and agents throughout the villages and towns of the Christians, and receiving the revenues and tributes from the provincials and other inhabitants, which they used formerly to pay to the Christians ; and these same provincials were now become enemies to, and rebels against.

Hence it was that when, by the advice of our brethren, we consented to the election of our venerable brother, formerly bishop of Norwich, as pastor of the church of Winchester, we sent particular entreaties to you that you would, out of reverence to the divine Being, and respect to ourself, show yourself kind in feeling and mild in your actions towards him, and that you would promptly and kindly cause to be assigned to him the castles and manors pertaining to that church. You, however, as we have heard to our astonishment and grie\^ not only would not allow our request to be carried into effect, but also, what is a more serious offence, you broke forth into speeches devoid of all due moderation and filial respect, declaring that no election in the kingdom of England ought to, or could be, allowed by the Apostolic See against your wish ; that, as we had power in spiritual affairs, so you had authority in temporal matters ; and that no one who was elected could obtain possession of temporal property without your consent ; you added, moreover, that you considered the translation of the said bishop as invalid, as having been obtained from us by false and underhanded means. These proceedings, my well-beloved son, do not redound to the honour of God, the Church, or yourself; they taste not of justice, they savour not of equity, especially as the pious belief of all Christians is that, by God\*s providence, the authority of the Apostolic See has fvdl power in all church matters, and that they are not obliged to abide the decision of princes so as to require their consent in matters of elections and expostulations ; in which matters the said Apostolic See proceeds so deliberately and wisely, that honour can suffer no detraction, and nothing can happen derogatory to justice. Thus also it has proceeded in the translation of this said bishop, in advancing whom it has promoted a man distinguished alike for his knowledge, morals, and probity, one prudent in spiritual as well as temporal afi\^drs, and one formerly dearly beloved by you, one who endeavours by all his efforts to attend to your wishes as £a,r as his duty to the Lord allows him, and one by whose tried industry you may gain increase of honour and advantage. Do not, then, allow yourself to be imposed upon by the cunning devices of underhanded advisers, who are induced to do injury to 2u2

Besides this, consider deeply on the fsucta, that in the performance of the duties of onr apostolic office we are subservient to the honour of the divine name ; tlieretore do not recall to your mind, nor disturb by any impediments, the proceedings which we have taken, after particular deliberation, in the case of the aforesaid bishop ; out as we have determined, in our own mind, to hold you in especial favour above all the other \])rinces of the earth, you will of necessity act honourably towards him, and, putting aside all difficulties, with goodwill resign and grant to him all the castles and manors with the produce which has accrued therefrom since the time of his translation ; in order that, under your especial favour, he tnay undertake the cares of the office intrusted to him, and bring them to good effect ; otherwise, as we do not choose the liberies of the Church to be lessened in our time, but rather that they should be increased, we shall by no means be able to endure so prejudicial an injury in the person of the said bishop.

The pope also wrote an eloquent letter in a similar strain, on behalf of the bishop of Winchester, to the queen of England, at the commencement of which he declared t)iat she, the queen, was a relation of his, --- \^we know not on what account, unless perhaps to make her more compliant in this business of his, and more favourable to his requests. He then asks and exhorts her (knowing that a woman is so called, because

He also wrote to the archbishop elect of Canterbury, and to the bishops of Worcester and Hereford, urging them to interest themselves diligently in this said matter, adding at the end of his letter an injunction to them to send him in their letters of reply the names of the underhanded advisers who perverted the king\'s mind. The bishop of Winchester\'s letter to the king, \" To the most eocceUerUy dhc, dec. --- Whereas we desire, as for as it is compatible with our reverence for God, to use our utmost eftorts to cultivate your good-will, we have received with all due respect brother Hugh of St. Tudor, who was sent to us by your majesty. On his afterwards putting certain questions to us in your name, we replied to them one by one, following, as we believe, the path ot justice and equity, as the aforesaid brother Hugh (as we have heard from him) will fully intimate to your majesty in his letters. As we desire with our whole hearts to fulfil, as &.r as we can with due reverence to God, your wish on the said matters, we most humbly beg of you, in your respect for the Apostolic See, to compassionate the sufferings of the church of Winchester, to receive us into your favour and grace, and in respect to the Divine name, mercifully to abate the anger which your majesty, perhaps at the instigation of whisperers, has conceived against us.\" The Icing\'s objections to the bishop of Winchester, As mention has been made of the points concerning which the king convened the bishop of Winchester, it ought to be known how and with what arguments the bishop replied to them. In the first place, that, as a decree had been obtained of old, both by the purports of the privileges of the king, and also by right and by the custom of the kingdom, that those who were nominated and elected should, after their nomination and election by their nominators and electors, be presented to the king, and should, after confirmation, \* The original is a pun, and difficult to express in English.

Secondly, that the said bishop should absolve the city of Winchester from the sentence of interdict promulgated against it. Thirdly, that on receipt of security, he should absolve all clerks, laymen, and others, and especially the people of Winchester, from the sentence of excommunication which he had prcmounced against them on account of the controversy which had arisen between the king and himself. Fourthly, that he should not remove the prior of Winchester, whom he, the king, had installed there ; but should allow him to remain in his favour. Fifthly, that he should ratify all ecclesiastical benefices in his presentation, in the bishopric of Winchester, or in any other, which had been given away by the king since the commencement of the controversy, and should allow the holders of them to enjoy peaceable possession. Sixthly, that he should not institute any proceedings against Master Henry de Seusa, or any other clerks or monks named, on account of this controvergfy ; but should pardon all offences and injuries, and abandon all feelings of indignation and rancour. Seventhly, that if any claim or cause of action existed with him concerning the produce of Winchester for past time, he should, out of respect to the king and from feelings of liberality, remit the same to him, the king. Eighthly, that the said bishop should abandon all feelings of anger against those whose names should, by his, the king\'s, order, be transmitted to him by the bishops of Worcester and Hereford, and the archdeacon of Canterbury, and should admit them to his full favoui;, so that they should be preserved harmless, as for as regarded their good name, benefices, and condition. The bishop of Winchester\'s reply. To the first article of demand made by the king, the bishop of Winchester replies, that those who nominated him, after demanding permission from the king, presented him to the king, according to the custom of the Hngdom, and that after 

But as they could not by the most urgent entreaties obtain this, nothing could be considered to have been omitted on his, the bishop\'s part, as it was not owing to him that everything contained and required in the said article of the king\'s demand was not fulfilled. To the second and third articles the bishop replied, that if he could obtain the king\'s £Ei\>vour (which he desired with his whole heart), and could obtain peaceable possession of his bishopric, he would out of kindness withdraw the sentences of excommunication and interdict in form of law; but that he could not, with due reverence to the Lord and respect to justice, bind himself to this by any bond of agreement ; but that, in compliance with the king\'s request, he intended to grant all absolution from excommunication which he could do without inconformity with his duty to the Lord. To the four succeeding articles he repHed, that as they only had reference to spiritual matters, or other things connected with them, and which, consequently, did not allow of his making a covenant and agreement, he could not fulfil those articles in the manner required by the king ; nevertheless, that, when he should be received into &vour by the king and obtain peaceable possession of his bishopric, he would, with the help of the advice of the king and his Mthful counsellors, act with great mildness, and show himself as favourable to the king\'s request as he could, conformably with his duty to the Lord. To the article concerning the produce of the proceeds of the bishopric, he replied, that when he obtained the king\'s favour and peaceable possession of his bishopric, and when he was satisfied concerning those proceeds, he would obey the king\'s pleasure, so as to merit commendation from him.

On considering all these matters, therefore, he, with the money, of which he had obtained no small sum from the king, made Mends of the mammon of imrighteousness, and procured for himself (would that he had not) a bishopric in his own country ; and he, a messenger himself became like the raven that deceived its master Noah, and, basely leaving an unskilful deputy to bear the burden which he had taken on his own shoulders, he disappeared from the kingdom well &ttened on the good things of it, and never after showed himself therein.

WEBSTER\'S INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY. ad tu H An entirely New Edition of Webster\^ s Dictionary\^ thoroughly Revised, considerably Enlarged, and reset in New Type from beginning to end, \' Demy \\to, 211Z pages, 3500 illustrations. Prices: Cloth, £1 iis. 6d. ; half-calf, £2 2S. ; half-russia, £2 5s.; calf, £2 8s. Also in 2 vols, cloth, £z 14s. In addition to the Dictionary of Words, with their pronunciation, etymology, alternative spellings, and various meanings, illustrated by quotations and numerous woodcuts, there are several valuable appendices, comprising a Pronouncing Gazetteer of the World ; Vocabularies of Scripture, Greek, Latin, and English Proper Names ; a Dictionary of the noted Names of Fiction ; a Brief History of the English Language ; a Dictionary of Foreign Quotations, Words, Phrases, Proverbs, &c. ; a Biographical Dictionary with 10,000 Names, &c. This last revision, comprising and superseding the issues of 1847, 1864, and 1880, is by far the most complete that the Work has undergone during the sixty-two years that it has been before the public. Every page has been treated as if the book were now published for the first time. J.\' SOME PRESS OPINIONS ON THE NEW EDITION. --- \* We believe that, all things considered, this will be found to be the best J« existing English dictionary in one volume. We do not know of any work --- • similar in size and price which can approach it in completeness of vocabulary, variety of information, and general usefulness.\* --- Guardian. \*The most comprehensive and the most useful of its kind.\' --- National Observer, \*A magnificent edition of Webster\'s immortal Dictionary.\' --- Daily Telegraph. \* A thoroughly practical and useful dictionary.\* --- Standard. \* A special feature of the present book is the lavish use of engravings, which at once illustrate the verbal explanations of technical and scientific terms, and permit them to remain readably brief. It may be enough to refer to the article on \*\' Cross.\" By the use of the little numbered diagrams we are spared what would have become a treatise, and not a very clear one. . . . We recommend the new Webster to every man of business, every father of a family, every teacher, and almost every student --- to everybody, in fact, who is likely to be posed at an unfamiliar or half-understood word or phrase.\' --- St, James\'s Gazette, Prospectuses\^ with Specimen Pages\^ on application. London : GEORGE BELL & SONS, York Street, Covent Garden.
