# Brevis Nota Writing Style Guide

## Overview

The *Brevis nota eorum quae in concilio Lugdunensi gesta sunt* ("A Brief Account of the Events at the Council of Lyon") is an example of medieval conciliar documentation—an administrative record of ecclesiastical proceedings. This type of document, known as a *relatio* (report) or *acta* (acts), was produced by notaries, secretaries, or attendees to preserve an official record of council sessions. The style is functional, procedural, and deliberately impersonal, in stark contrast to the literary chronicle tradition exemplified by Matthew Paris.

This guide documents the distinctive features of this documentary style for the purpose of replication.

## I. Genre and Purpose

### Document Type
- **Relatio**: An official or semi-official report of proceedings
- **Brevis nota**: A "brief account"—summary rather than verbatim transcript
- **Acta concilii**: Acts of a council

### Purpose
- To preserve a record of what occurred at formal proceedings
- To document speeches, responses, and procedural actions
- To serve as evidence or reference for later use
- NOT to entertain, edify, or provide moral commentary

---

## II. Structural Elements

### Organization by Sessions
The document is structured around formal sessions (*sessiones*):

- "Secundo sessio fuit die Mercurii ad octo dies post" (The second session was on Wednesday, eight days later)
- References to postponement of sessions
- Clear demarcation between what happened in each session

### Section/Paragraph Structure
- Numbered or clearly delineated sections
- Each section typically covers one discrete action or speech
- Chronological progression within sessions

### Session Conclusions
Formulaic endings mark the close of each session:

- "Et sic illius diei fuit sessio terminata." (And thus the session of that day was concluded.)
- "Et ita in secunda sessione nichil aliud fuit factum." (And so in the second session nothing else was done.)

---

## III. Narrative Voice

### Impersonal Third Person
The author is entirely invisible. There is:
- No first-person singular or plural
- No authorial opinion or commentary
- No "we have heard" or "it is said"
- No moral judgments from the narrator

**Contrast with Matthew Paris**: Where Matthew Paris writes "Many were astonished at this" or "Wherefore it is to be wondered at," the Brevis Nota simply records what happened without evaluation.

### Observer Stance
The narrator functions as an invisible recording device:
- Reports actions without interpreting them
- Summarizes speeches without editorializing
- Notes reactions of others but does not share the narrator's own reaction

---

## IV. Transitional Phrases

### Temporal/Sequential Markers
Formulaic phrases connect events:

| Latin | English | Usage |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Quibus peractis | When these things were completed | After ceremonial/procedural matters |
| Quibus dictis | When these things had been said | After speeches |
| Postmodum | Afterwards | General sequence |
| Item | Likewise | Additional items in a list |
| Tunc | Then | Next action |
| Statim | Immediately | Quick succession |
| Veruntamen | Nevertheless | Contrast or qualification |
| Et sic | And thus | Concluding |

**Example**: "Quibus peractis statim Calinensis... surrexit" (When these matters were completed, immediately [the bishop] of Calvi rose)

---

## V. Reporting Speech and Actions

### Physical Actions
A limited vocabulary describes participants' actions:

- **surrexit** (rose/stood up) — the primary verb for someone taking the floor
- **incepit predicare** (began to preach)
- **fecit legi** (had [something] read out)
- **ostendit** (showed/displayed)
- **proposuit** (put forward/proposed)
- **respondit** (responded)
- **supplicavit** (pleaded/petitioned)
- **promisit** (promised)

**Pattern**: "[Person] surrexit et [action]" — "[Person] rose and [did something]"

**Example**: "Tunc surrexit index Tadeus et multa gravia proposuit contra dictum episcopum" (Then the judge Thaddaeus rose and brought forward many grave accusations against the said bishop)

### Indirect Discourse
Speeches are summarized rather than quoted directly:

- "...referens rumores de hiis que tunc acciderant ultra mare" (relating reports of those things which had then occurred overseas)
- "...promittens, quod ipse ac alii prelati Yspanie... domino pape assisterent" (promising that he and the other prelates of Spain would assist the lord Pope)
- "...asserere multa mala, que fecisse et procurasse dicebat ecclesiam contra eum" (asserting many evil things that the Church had done and contrived against him, as he claimed)

### Reported Content Structure
When summarizing a speech, the pattern is often:
1. Speaker rises (*surrexit*)
2. General characterization of what they did (*descripsit*, *proposuit*, *respondit*)
3. Summary of content using indirect discourse
4. Audience reaction (optional)

---

## VI. Evaluative Language

### Minimal but Present
Unlike Matthew Paris's frequent moral commentary, evaluative language is sparse and restrained:

- **mirabiliter** (remarkably/wonderfully) — used for notable performances
  - "mirabiliter excusare videbatur imperatorem" (seemed to excuse the emperor remarkably well)
  - "mirabiliter descripsit vitam ac malum... progressum" (remarkably described the life and evil conduct)

- **bene** (well)
  - "dominus papa respondit ad singula bene" (the lord Pope responded well to each point)

- **manifestissime** (most manifestly)
  - "prout manifestissime apparebat" (as was most manifestly apparent)

### Audience Reactions
Notes how speeches were received, without narrator's own judgment:

- "multis eius responsio fuit grata" (his response was pleasing to many)
- "contra multorum prelatorum voluntatem" (against the will of many prelates)

---

## VII. Documentary References

### Types of Documents Mentioned
- **litterae** (letters)
- **privilegium/privilegia** (privilege/privileges)
- **aurea bulla** (golden bull/seal)
- **paria litterarum** (copies of letters)

### Reading Documents Aloud
A key procedural element—documents are formally read into the record:

- "fecit legi quoddam privilegium" (he had a certain privilege read out)
- "Item fecit legi plura alia privilegia aurea bulla munita" (Likewise, he had read out many other privileges fortified with golden seals)

### Evidential Function
Documents are cited as proof:
- "ostendit super hiis plurima paria litterarum" (he showed many copies of letters concerning these matters)
- "quod maxime patebat per litteras, quas per mundum... transmittebat" (this was most evident from the letters which he sent throughout the world)

---

## VIII. Legal and Ecclesiastical Terminology

### Feudal/Legal Terms
- **vassallus** (vassal)
- **feudum** (fief)
- **fidelitatem prestare** (to render fealty)
- **quittare** (to quitclaim)
- **concedere** (to grant)
- **confirmare** (to confirm)

### Ecclesiastical Terms
- **sessio** (session)
- **synodus/concilium** (synod/council)
- **prelati** (prelates)
- **clerici** (clergy)
- **ecclesia** (church)
- **dominus papa** (the lord Pope)

### Territorial Terms

- **marchia** (march)
- **comitatus** (county)
- **exarchatus** (exarchate)
- **patrimonium beati Petri** (patrimony of Blessed Peter)

---

## IX. Enumeration and Lists

### Numbered Lists
The "five sorrows" passage demonstrates formal enumeration:

- "Primus erat de..." (The first was concerning...)
- "secundus de..." (the second concerning...)
- "tertius de..." (the third concerning...)
- "quartus de..." (the fourth concerning...)
- "quintus de..." (the fifth concerning...)

### Geographical Lists
Territories are enumerated in legal fashion:
- "totam terram a castro Radicophani usque ad castrum Ceperani, marchiam Anchonitanam, ducatum Spoletii, exarchatum Ravenne et Pentapolim, comitatum Brittenorii et terram comitisse Mathildis"

### Concluding Lists
- "et multa alia erant ibi" (and many other things were contained therein)

---

## X. Atmosphere and Context

### Security Concerns
Notes about armed protection without dramatic elaboration:
- "Templariorum et Hospitalariorum, qui multos armatos ad custodiam domini pape et concilii ipsius studuerant destinare" (of the Templars and Hospitallers, who had taken care to send many armed men for the protection of the lord Pope and his council)
- "que custodiebantur per armatos plurimos die ac nocte" (which was guarded by many armed men both day and night)

### Procedural Delays
Records requests for postponement matter-of-factly:
- "supplicavit instanter, quod prorogaretur tercia sessio" (urgently pleaded that the third session be postponed)

---

## XIII. Replication Guidelines

To write in the Brevis Nota style:

1. **Remove yourself entirely**: No first person, no opinions, no "it seemed to me"

2. **Open with transitional formula**: "Quibus peractis..." or "Quibus dictis..."

3. **Identify speakers by role/title**: "the judge Thaddaeus," "the bishop of Calvi," "an archbishop from Spain"

4. **Use "surrexit" for taking the floor**: "[Person] rose and [action]"

5. **Summarize speeches in indirect discourse**: Do not quote directly; paraphrase content

6. **Note documentary evidence**: Letters read, privileges displayed, seals mentioned

7. **Use minimal evaluative language**: "mirabiliter," "bene," "manifestissime" only

8. **Record audience reactions impersonally**: "his response was pleasing to many"

9. **Close sessions formulaically**: "And thus the session of that day was concluded"

10. **Enumerate formally**: "The first... the second... the third..."

11. **Note procedural matters**: Postponements, scheduling, attendance

12. **Include security/atmosphere only as relevant fact**: Armed guards present, tension in the city

## XIV. Source Information

This style guide was compiled from the *Brevis nota eorum quae in concilio Lugdunensi gesta sunt*, as published in MGH (Monumenta Germaniae Historica) Constitutiones et acta publica imperatorum et regum, Tomus II, pp. 514-515, Nr. 401. The document records proceedings at the First Council of Lyon (1245), convened by Pope Innocent IV, which resulted in the deposition of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.

The Brevis Nota represents a genre of medieval administrative documentation distinct from literary chronicles. Its impersonal, procedural style served the needs of institutional record-keeping rather than historical narrative, and its conventions reflect the formal requirements of ecclesiastical and legal documentation in the thirteenth century.
