**(1)** ...

**(2)** When these matters were completed, he [the Pope] began to preach on the authority of the prophet: "According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, thy consolations have gladdened my soul,"¹ beginning with the point that his sorrow was manifold, because five sorrows had surrounded him. The first was concerning the moral corruption of prelates and their subjects; the second concerning the insolence of the Saracens; the third concerning the schism of the Greeks; the fourth concerning the savagery of the Tartars; the fifth concerning the persecution by the Emperor Frederick. Returning to the first article concerning the moral corruption of prelates and their subjects—because they were not such as they ought to be and should be—he said much about their excesses. Afterwards concerning the insolence of the Saracens, relating reports of those things which had then occurred overseas: how they had occupied Jerusalem and overthrown it, and had slaughtered the people of the Lord and even the sacred places in those regions, and had perpetrated the killing of countless Christians and whoever else was found there. Thirdly, concerning the schism of the Greeks: how Vatatzes,² the Emperor of the Greeks, together with the schismatic Greeks, had occupied and destroyed the land almost up to Constantinople, and would have driven [the Latins] from the city, unless they were willing to receive assistance from Christians. Fourthly, concerning the savagery of the Tartars: how they had entered the land of the Christians and had occupied Hungary, sparing neither sex nor age—all of whom they slaughtered. Fifthly, concerning the persecution by the said emperor: how he persecuted the Church, and how he and his predecessors had been persecutors of the Greeks; and in the letters which he sent throughout the world to the aforesaid emperor,³ he publicly declared that he was not persecuting the true Church but the Pope—which was not true, as was most manifestly apparent, since during the vacancy of the Church⁴ he did not cease to persecute it; indeed, he afflicted the clergy and the Church even more.

**(3)** And after he had said many things about this affliction, he had read out a certain privilege with a golden seal⁵ granted by the same emperor—when he was not yet king—to his predecessor Honorius,⁶ in which among other things it was most especially stated how, upon entering [his office], he would render his fealty to him as a vassal to a lord; and it stated that he held the kingdoms of Sicily and Apulia, and also the special patrimony of Blessed Peter, and held it from the Church in fief; and he granted and quitclaimed any rights he might have had in the elections of churches in the aforesaid kingdom, and made the churches free, exempt, and immune from all exaction. Likewise, he had read out many other privileges fortified with golden seals, granted to the Church while he was king and afterwards as emperor, in which it was stated that he quitclaimed, donated, granted, and confirmed all the land from the castle of Radicofani to the castle of Ceprano, the March of Ancona, the Duchy of Spoleto, the Exarchate of Ravenna and the Pentapolis, the County of Bertinoro, and the land of the Countess Matilda;⁷ and many other things were contained therein.

**(4)** When these things had been said, the judge Thaddaeus,⁸ one of the envoys of the emperor, rose and responded to nearly every point that the lord Pope had made, and seemed to excuse the emperor remarkably well, and asserted many evil things that the Church had done and contrived against him, as he claimed, and showed many copies of letters concerning these matters; and his response was pleasing to many. But the lord Pope responded well to each point, as if he had foreseen it, excusing himself and the Church. And thus the session of that day was concluded.

**(5)** The second session was on Wednesday, eight days later, and what was done in the session on that appointed day was the same as in the first. When these matters were completed, immediately [the bishop] of Calvi,⁹ of the Cistercian order, from the kingdom of Apulia, who was in exile, rose and remarkably described the life and the evil and ignominious conduct of the said emperor, and his deeds, and what his intention was—that is, that he intended to command that prelates and clergy should return to that poverty in which they had been in the time of the primitive Church; this was most evident from the letters which he sent throughout the world against the Church. Afterwards, an archbishop from Spain rose, who greatly encouraged the lord Pope to proceed against the emperor, relating many things which he had done against the Church, and what his whole intention had been, and how he had unjustly oppressed the Church as much as he could, promising that he and other prelates of Spain, who would act most magnificently and would come to the council for other matters, would assist the lord Pope in person and in resources according to his good pleasure and will. Other prelates promised the same in that synod as well.

**(6)** Then the judge Thaddaeus rose and brought forward many grave accusations against the said bishop of Calvi—that he had spoken not from zeal for justice but from malevolence, etc.—and had offered many excuses for the emperor. And so in the second session nothing else was done. Nevertheless, the said judge Thaddaeus urgently pleaded that the third session be postponed, because the emperor—as he knew through certain messengers (and he himself, who had been in the city of Turin, had sent several others to him)—had set out on the journey to come to the council. And because the lord Pope greatly desired this, he postponed the third session until Monday after the octave of the second session, which was on Wednesday, against the will of many prelates. This was not without the opposition of many prelates and others—of the Templars and Hospitallers, who had taken care to send many armed men for the protection of the lord Pope and his council—and because of the presumed [danger from] men and the fear which existed in that city, which was guarded by many armed men both day and night in secret.

### Notes on the Translation

This document is a contemporary or near-contemporary account of the First Council of Lyon (1245), convened by Pope Innocent IV, which ultimately resulted in the deposition of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. The account describes:

- **Section (2)**: Innocent IV's opening sermon on his "five sorrows" afflicting Christendom
- **Section (3)**: The reading of Frederick II's earlier privileges and oaths to the Church, demonstrating his broken promises
- **Section (4)**: Thaddaeus of Suessa's defense of the emperor at the first session
- **Section (5)**: The second session, including damning testimony from the exiled Bishop of Calvi
- **Section (6)**: Thaddaeus's request for a delay to allow the emperor to appear in person, and the atmosphere of armed tension at the council

The Latin is typical of 13th-century documentary prose—functional rather than elegant, with some grammatical irregularities that may reflect either the original composition or transmission errors. Some passages are corrupt or unclear in the manuscript tradition.
