Tomas Aquinas (1225-1274)  was an Italian Dominican friar, philosopher and theologian who became one of the most influential thinkers in Western intellectual history.   His written works contain over 8 million words (equating to about 1000 words per day, every day, for over 21 years)  His masterwork, the Summa Theologica, remains a foundational text in Catholic philosophy and covers everything from the existence of God to ethics and the nature of the soul.  

This life of prolific writing ended, when in December 1273, Aquinas had a profound experience during mass that caused him to stop writing entirely.   When his friend and secretary Reginald of Piperno urged him to continue his work, Aquinas reportedly said "I cannot, because all that I have written seems like straw to me now." The exact nature of his experience remains debated.  Some interpret it as a mystical vision that made his intellectual achievements feel insignificant by comparison.   Others have suggested it may have been a stroke or some kind of physical or mental breakdown as he had been working at an extraordinary pace for years.  

Whatever had happened to Aquinas in December 1273, He never wrote again, and the Suma Theologica was left unfinished.   

In 1274, Pope Gregory X called the ecumenical council of Lyon in France, in the hopes of uniting Western Catholicism with Eastern Orthodoxy.   Thomas Aquinas had been summoned to the council as an intellectual giant, to aid in convincing the Orthodox church of their errors.  One of his works was specifically aimed at this purpose:   Contra Errores Graecorum, or Against the Errors of the Greeks.   Unfortunately, Thomas Aquinas died in march 1274, while on the road to the city of Lyon.  

Except we have found evidence there is evidence that he did not die on the road to Lyon.   



"I was sent to tell you why you're wrong. But I've seen something. And I think maybe you understood something we forgot."

  Brothers in Christ, gathered servants of the living God—

  I come before you not as the man who was summoned. Pope Gregory called for Thomas the theologian,
  Thomas the systematizer, Thomas who has spent twenty years building cathedrals of words to house the
   Divine. That man set out from Naples with his manuscripts and his arguments. But that man did not
  arrive. Something happened to him on the road—no, before the road, in a chapel in December, during
  the elevation of the Host—and what stands before you now is what remains.

  I was sent to read to you from my treatise against the errors of the Greeks. I have the pages here.
  I could recite them from memory, as I once could recite anything. But I must confess to you, my
  brothers—and I use that word with more weight than I have ever used it—I no longer know what an
  "error" is when we speak of the Infinite. I have seen—no, "seen" is wrong, there are no eyes for
  this—I have been shown that the God we debate is not a proposition to be correct about. He is not a
  territory to be mapped with Latin words or Greek words. He is... I cannot say what He is. I can only
   tell you that I was held in the palm of something, and I understood that my eight million words
  were the babbling of an infant who believes he has explained his father.

  I look now at this schism—two hundred and twenty years of Christians refusing the Eucharist to
  Christians—and I am undone.  I am cut to the marrow. We have let children grow up and die, generation after
  generation, being taught that their brothers across the sea are enemies of God. For what? For the
  filioque? For whether the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone or from the Father and the Son? I
  have written precisely on this question. I have been very clear, very rigorous, very correct. 
  You cannot know how tender you all are to me now.  How precious. All of you, with your arguments 
  and your certainties, your councils and your anathemas. You
  have been keeping something closed, my brothers, and you did not even know it. The wound in the Body
   of Christ we call The Church.  I called it a wound. I used to weep over it. I do not weep now.
   I see its purpose now.  I see that there are things that love us enough to let us remain divided, 
  because this division is a protection,  and unity, true unity, the kind I once prayed for, 
  opens doors that perhaps should stay shut. I have walked through such a door. I cannot walk back.

  I know what you expect of me. You expect the Dumb Ox to low and bellow and crush the Eastern
  position beneath the weight of Aristotelian categories. There are men in this room who have waited
  years for this. But I have no arguments left in me. I have only this: I have the deepest love for you.
  I have love for the Greeks.  I have love for the farmers in Calabria who have never read a word 
  of theology but who cross themselves and  trust that Christ is risen.

  I have love for the monks on Athos who have touched the hem of what I have seen and called it 
  theosis.  They, of all of us have come close, so very close, to understanding.  We are all so
  beautiful in our not-knowing. 

  We have broken something holy.   Something words cannot mend, neither silence. So I will speak.
  Not to win, not to be correct.  Only to say I am sorry.  I am sorry that I have begun to see the truth.  
  I am sorry that I have begun to know.  I would give every book I have written to un-see, to un-know.
  Wheels within wheels.

  What I wish to tell you, perhaps the same message I have always been attempting and failing to convey, 
  is not about doctrine. 
  Although the prophets tried to warn us in the book of Ezekiel, and in the book of Revelation. 
  It is about what remains when doctrine burns away. 
  as it is written: 'Their entire bodies, including their backs, hands, and wings were full of eyes all around.
  It is when the truth is revealed and what remains is laid bare before us... 

  And what remains, my brothers, has so very many eyes.

  The first murmurs began when Thomas smiled. In twenty years of teaching, disputation, and
  ecclesiastical politics, no one present had ever seen Thomas smile like that. It was too wide. It
  involved too many teeth. Cardinal Bonaventure would later write that it reminded him of a wound.

  "I was shown something," Thomas continued, his voice still gentle, still warm. "and I was told 'BE NOT AFRAID'."

  A papal secretary noticed that Thomas had begun swaying slightly, almost imperceptibly, as though
  keeping time to some distant liturgy.

  "The Greeks are not wrong, my brothers. Nor are we. We are both so much less than wrong that the
  word loses meaning. We have been disputing the procession of the Spirit as though we understood what
   'procession' means. As though we understood what a 'Spirit' is. We have been very precise about the
   furniture of a house we have never entered."

  He stopped. His eyes found something above the assembly—or behind them—or in a direction the
  architecture did not contain.

  "Forgive me. " He reached into his robes and produced what appeared to be his well-known manuscript,
  Contra errores graecorum, or 'Against the errors of the Greeks'.  "It is not the Father. It is not the Son. 
  It is not the Spirit, filioque or otherwise. There have certainly been errors" Thomas' voice begins to trail off
  "... and I have made corrections."

  He began reading from his manuscript. The words were not Latin. They were not Greek. 

  The records of the Council of Lyon, 1274, end here.
  In later accounts of the event, several monks would insist they were not words, 
  that they were older than words, that words had been built over them the way cathedrals are built over catacombs."

  Officially, the final pages were lost to water damage.

  Footnote: In this timeline, the Dominican Order's motto "Veritas" was quietly changed in 1277 to
  "Nescire" ("To not know"), and the Summa Theologica was placed on the Index of Forbidden Books,
  where it remains to this day. The Eastern and Western churches reunified within eighteen months—not
  through theological agreement, but through what Vatican sources describe only as "mutual defensive
  necessity." The nature of the threat is not specified. The record-keepers who might have specified
  it are no longer record-keepers. They are no longer anything that requires a job title.
