# Matthew Paris Writing Style Guide

## Overview

Matthew Paris (c. 1200-1259) was a Benedictine monk at St. Alban's Abbey and one of the most important medieval English chroniclers. His *Chronica Majora* (Greater Chronicle) covers English and European history from 1235 to 1259 (with earlier sections borrowed from Roger of Wendover). This guide documents his distinctive writing style for the purpose of replication.

## I. Structural Elements

### Temporal Markers and Transitions
Matthew Paris organizes his chronicle annalistically (by year) and uses formulaic phrases to transition between events:

- "About this time..."
- "In the same year..."
- "About the same time..."
- "At this time..."
- "About this same time..."
- "In the spring of the same year..."
- "When the nuptial rejoicings were concluded..."
- "Not long afterwards..."
- "In this year, too..."

**Example**: "About the same time, the emperor sent messengers to the king, demanding from him a large sum of money which he, the king, had promised him with his sister."

### Section Headers
Uses descriptive headers for each discrete event or topic:
- "Of the vengeance taken for the death of Earl Richard the marshal"
- "The insolence of the Minorite Brethren"
- "A disagreement between the citizens of Orleans and the clergy"
- "The death of Robert Fitz-Walter and Roger de Sumerie"
- "Heavy falls of rain"
- "A prodigy"

## II. Narrative Voice

### Third-Person Omniscient
Writes as an authoritative observer with access to councils, private conversations, and inner motivations. Does not claim to have personally witnessed most events but presents them with confidence.

### Editorial Commentary
Frequently inserts his own moral judgments, opinions, and interpretations:

- "Many were astonished at this, and said that the king was endeavouring much more than became him..."
- "This appeared to all to be an unjust and tyrannical action..."
- "By these, and such like examples, it can be clearly weighed in the balance of reason, how disrespected was the severity of law..."
- "Wherefore it is to be wondered at that Mahomet, by such prevarications, inclined men of wisdom and power to his faith."

### First-Person Plural (Authorial "We")
Uses "we" when inserting commentary or explaining his methods:
- "As we have commenced to give an account of this impostor..."
- "...we have thought proper to insert it in these pages."
- "...from which we heard from a celebrated preacher of great renown..."

## IV. Religious and Moral Framework

### Biblical and Scriptural References
Frequently quotes scripture to support moral points:

- "Though an angel shall preach to you the contrary of these things, let him be accursed."
- "Thou art Peter, and on this rock will I build my church..."

### Providential Interpretation
Interprets events as manifestations of divine will:
- "...God deigned to work so miraculously..."
- "The Lord therefore struck him with incurable epilepsy..."
- "...the times of the apostles seemed to be renewed"

### Moral Condemnation
Expresses strong disapproval of vice, heresy, and corruption:
- "...the foul contagion of lustful wickedness, by which its beauty was seriously blemished"
- "...the false doctrine, yea, the madness of Mahomet"
- "...this inveigler of souls"
- "...the heretical wickedness of the people"

## V. Rhetorical Devices

### Rhetorical Questions
Used to engage the reader or express wonder:
- "Why should I describe all those persons who reverently ministered in the church to God as was their duty?"
- "Why describe the abundance of meats and dishes on the table?"
- "Whence arises this fickleness in the Roman court and the pope?"

### Wordplay and Etymology
Offers etymological explanations, sometimes fanciful:
- "They were truly named Caursines---if I may play upon the word---from cansor, to cheat, or capio, to take, and ursinum, bearish."
- "...it is called a mouse, from the moisture of the earth"

### Classical Quotations
Includes Latin verse and classical references:
- "Quia me vestigia terrent / Omnia te venum spectantia, nulla retrorsum" (Horace)
- "[We are but cattle prone to vice]"

### Metaphor and Simile
Uses vivid figurative language:
- "...fuel being daily added to it, it burst forth into a most implacable hatred"
- "Truly was this Mahomet a poisonous dragon, a beast blooded with the slaughter of many"
- "...attracted, as it were, by the sweet-smelling odour of his perfumes"
- "...the dragon with his tail has dragged a portion of the stars from heaven"

## VI. Documentary Style

### Direct Quotation of Sources
Includes full texts of letters, treaties, and legal documents with formal language:

### Detailed Enumeration
Provides exhaustive lists of names, genealogies, and attendees:

## X. Sample Passage for Style Reference

> "About this same time, in the month of May, near an abbacy called Roche, in the northern part of England, there appeared bands of well-armed knights, riding on valuable horses, with standards and shields, coats of mail and helmets, and decorated with other military equipments: they issued from the earth, as it appeared, and disappeared again into the earth. This vision lasted for several days, and attracted the eyes of those who beheld it, as if by fascination; they rode in arrayed troops, and sometimes engaged in conflict; sometimes as if at a tournament, they shivered their spears into small fragments with a crash; the inhabitants saw them, but more from a distance than near them, for they never remember to have seen such a sight before, and many said that the occurrence was not without its presage."

## XII. Source Information

This style guide was compiled from *Matthew Paris's English History*, translated from the Latin by Rev. J. A. Giles, D.C.L., published by George Bell & Sons, London, 1889. The chronicle covers the years 1235-1273, with the portion from 1235 onward being Matthew Paris's original composition (earlier material was adapted from Roger of Wendover's *Flowers of History*).

Matthew Paris was a monk of St. Alban's Abbey who confined his attention wholly to the study of history, and particularly the history of his own country. His work represents a unique blend of monastic chronicle, political commentary, and literary artistry that made him one of the most significant historians of medieval England.
