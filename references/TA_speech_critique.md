# Critique of TA_speech.md

A critical review with an eye toward historical accuracy, internal consistency, and opportunities for trimming.

## Historical Errors

### 1. Thomas citing Hebrew etymology (line 72)

> "The word in Hebrew is *em'as* — to reject, to refuse, to melt away."

**Problem:** Thomas Aquinas did not know Hebrew. He relied entirely on the Latin Vulgate and occasionally consulted scholars who knew the original languages. He would never cite a Hebrew etymology in a lecture.

**Recommendation:** Cut this sentence entirely, or replace with a Latin/patristic gloss on the passage.

---

### 2. "I have read Aristotle in the Greek" (line 41)

> "I have read Aristotle in the Greek and the Philosopher's Arabic commentators."

**Problem:** Thomas's Greek was limited. He relied heavily on William of Moerbeke's Latin translations of Aristotle. He commissioned translations precisely because he couldn't read Greek fluently. This line overstates his linguistic abilities.

**Recommendation:** Change to: "I have read the Philosopher in Latin and studied his Arabic commentators." Or simply cut the language reference.

---

### 3. Fabricated Gregory quotation (line 51)

> Hence Gregory says in his *Moralia*: *he who has only heard speaks boldly; he who has seen falls silent*.

**Problem:** This is not a real quotation from Gregory's *Moralia*. It's a paraphrase I invented. Presenting invented quotations as patristic authority is risky — a knowledgeable reader would notice.

**Recommendation:** Either find a genuine Gregory quotation that fits, or reframe as a general observation without direct attribution. Alternatively, cut the sentence.

---

## Internal Inconsistencies

### 4. The filioque explained twice

The procession of the Spirit is explained identically in both Chapter 1 (line 47) and Chapter 2 (line 70):

> "Does the Spirit proceed from the Father alone, or from the Father and the Son?"

**Problem:** Redundant. The audience (both the fictional council and the reader) doesn't need this explained twice.

**Recommendation:** Keep the fuller treatment in Chapter 2 (where it connects to the schism's meaninglessness). In Chapter 1, simply reference "the filioque" without re-explaining it.

---

### 5. "Eight million words" appears twice

Lines 41 and 62 both reference the eight million words.

**Assessment:** This might be intentional emphasis — the number haunts him. But it feels slightly redundant.

**Recommendation:** Consider keeping only the first instance (where it's introduced with the detail about secretaries counting), and in line 62 say simply "my words" or "all that I have written."

---

### 6. Tonal shift in Epilogus

The Epilogus (lines 114-134) shifts register noticeably. It's more direct, more colloquial, closer to the original story's voice than to the scholastic formality of the four chapters.

**Problem:** The "Dumb Ox" reference (line 124), while historically accurate, feels jarring after the elevated Latin chapter headings. The Epilogus reads like a different speech grafted onto the end.

**Recommendation:** Either revise the Epilogus to maintain scholastic register, or lean into the breakdown — make the tonal shift feel intentional, as if the formal structure is collapsing as Thomas approaches the unspeakable.

---

## Superfluous Content (Candidates for Cutting)

### 7. "Dust that has seen. Ashes that remember." (line 26)

Poetic but perhaps too modern in sensibility. The plain "dust and ashes, as Job says" is sufficient.

**Recommendation:** Cut "Dust that has seen. Ashes that remember."

---

### 8. The Augustine paraphrase (line 45)

> As Augustine says in the *Confessions*: we receive the words of others, and from their words we construct in our minds an image of what they describe. But the image is not the thing.

**Problem:** This is a loose paraphrase, not a direct quote. It's also somewhat generic — it doesn't add much that "hearing comes through mediation" doesn't already convey.

**Recommendation:** Either find a genuine Augustine quote or cut the attribution and present it as Thomas's own observation.

---

### 9. The Calabrian farmers (line 85)

> I have love for the farmers in Calabria who have never read a word of theology but who cross themselves and trust that Christ is risen.

**Assessment:** This is a nice detail and grounds the speech in ordinary piety. However, the list of those Thomas loves (Greeks, farmers, monks on Athos) is long.

**Recommendation:** Consider trimming. The monks on Athos are essential (theosis connection). The farmers could be cut if length is a concern.

---

### 10. "Wheels within wheels" orphaned (line 130)

In the original story, this phrase comes after explicit references to Ezekiel and Revelation. Here it appears abruptly in the Epilogus without adequate setup.

**Problem:** The Ezekiel reference in Chapter 2 (the eyes) doesn't mention wheels. So "wheels within wheels" arrives without its biblical anchor.

**Recommendation:** Either add the wheels reference earlier (in the Ezekiel passage, line 68), or cut it from the Epilogus. Alternatively, expand it slightly: "Wheels within wheels, as the prophet saw."

---

### 11. Chapter 3 — Weakest tripartite structure

The three "repentances" are:
1. Repentance for division
2. Repentance for speaking
3. Repentance for knowing

**Problem:** These don't quite parallel. "Division" is a collective sin; "speaking" and "knowing" are personal. The logic is strained. This chapter also overlaps thematically with Chapter 4 (silence).

**Recommendation:** This is the best candidate for significant cutting. Consider:
- Merging the essential content of Chapter 3 into Chapter 4
- Or reducing Chapter 3 to a single paragraph without tripartite division
- The "wound as protection / doors that should stay shut" material is essential and powerful; the rest is less so

---

### 12. Chapter 4, First point — redundant Gregory quote

> Gregory writes in his *Pastoral Care*: *the teacher ought not to preach to the unlearned all that he knows...*

This Gregory quote also appeared in the style guide as a model. It's authentic, but it's already been used in *Rigans Montes*. Using the same quote feels like repetition if the reader has seen both documents.

**Assessment:** This is probably fine — the documents have different purposes. But note for awareness.

---

## Structural Observations

### 13. Four chapters may be too many

The original story is a single, building speech that accelerates toward the unspeakable. The four-chapter structure creates a more measured, academic pace that somewhat dissipates the mounting dread.

**Recommendation:** Consider whether the speech could work as a three-part structure:
1. Hearing vs. Seeing (merge current Chapters 1-2)
2. Repentance (current Chapter 3, trimmed)
3. Silence (current Chapter 4)

Or even simpler:
1. What I was / What I have become
2. What I have seen
3. What I cannot say

## Summary of Recommended Cuts

| Line(s) | Content | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 72 | Hebrew etymology (*em'as*) | **Cut** — Thomas didn't know Hebrew |
| 41 | "in the Greek" | **Revise** — change to "in Latin" |
| 51 | Gregory quotation | **Cut or find real quote** |
| 47 | Filioque explanation (first instance) | **Trim** — don't re-explain in line 70 |
| 62 | "eight million words" (second instance) | **Revise** — use "all I have written" |
| 26 | "Dust that has seen. Ashes that remember." | **Cut** |
| 85 | Calabrian farmers | **Optional cut** for length |
| 130 | "Wheels within wheels" | **Anchor or cut** |
| Ch. 3 | Entire tripartite structure | **Consider merging into Ch. 4** |

## What Works Well

- The **thema** (Job 42:5-6) is excellent — perfect for the hearing/seeing transformation
- The **structure straining and breaking** (Chapter 4's third point cut off) is effective
- The **Dionysius reference** to entering darkness is apt
- The **theosis** reference connects East and West meaningfully
- The **"many eyes"** thread is genuinely unsettling
- The **final lines** about words older than words are strong
- The **humility** is authentic to Thomas's voice

The bones are good. The flesh could be leaner.
