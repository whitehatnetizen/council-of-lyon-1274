# Thomas Aquinas: Lecture Style Guide

## Overview

This guide analyzes the rhetorical and pedagogical style of Thomas Aquinas based on his *Rigans Montes* ("Watering the Mountains"), the inaugural lecture delivered upon becoming Regent Master of Theology at the University of Paris in 1256. The guide provides principles for composing speeches, lectures, or sermons in the Thomistic manner.

## Core Characteristics

### 1. The Thema: A Central Scriptural Text

Every lecture begins with a **thema** — a biblical verse that serves as both the subject and the organizing metaphor for the entire discourse.

**Principle:** Choose a Scripture passage rich in imagery that can be allegorically unpacked. The thema is not mere decoration; it is the structural spine of the lecture.

**Example from Rigans Montes:**
> *Rigans montes de superioribus suis; de fructu operum tuorum satiabitur terra.*
> (*Watering the mountains from your upper rooms; the earth shall be filled with the fruit of your works.* — Psalm 103:13)

Thomas then systematically draws meaning from each element: the heights (divine wisdom), the mountains (teachers), the waters (doctrine), and the earth (students).

---

### 2. Explicit Structural Announcements

Thomas announces his organizational structure at the outset, telling the audience precisely what points he will cover.

**Principle:** State the division of your lecture clearly before proceeding. Use enumeration ("four things," "three reasons") to signal the architecture of your argument.

**Example:**
> "Therefore, this passage provides four items that should be considered, namely:
> - the heights of spiritual teaching,
> - the dignity of its teachers,
> - the condition of those who listen,
> - and the order of communication."

This technique:
- Prepares the listener's mind to receive information in an orderly way
- Creates a sense of logical inevitability
- Allows the audience to track their position within the argument

---

### 3. Tripartite Division

Thomas habitually divides topics into **three parts**. This is the signature of scholastic method.

**Principle:** When analyzing any subject, seek to identify three aspects, causes, or qualities. The number three provides balance and completeness without overwhelming complexity.

**Examples from Rigans Montes:**

On the heights of sacred doctrine:
> "Sacred doctrine has its height from three things:
> First, from its origin...
> Second, from the subtlety of its content...
> Third, from the sublimity of its end..."

On why teachers are signified by mountains:
> "...on account of three things:
> First, on account of the height of the mountains...
> Second, on account of their brilliance...
> Third, on account of the fortification of the mountains..."

On the qualities required of students:
> "...they should be lowly through humility...
> Likewise, they should be firm through rectitude...
> Likewise, they should be fruitful..."

---

### 4. Chains of Authority

Thomas builds arguments not from personal opinion but from accumulated authority: Scripture, the Church Fathers, and established commentators.

**Principle:** Support each point with citations. Create chains that move from Scripture to patristic interpretation to application. The argument gains force through the weight of tradition.

**Pattern:**
1. State the point
2. Cite Scripture
3. Cite a Father (Augustine, Gregory, Dionysius, Damascene)
4. Apply to the matter at hand

**Example:**
> "The King and Lord of the heavens instituted this law from eternity, that the gifts of his providence would come to lower things through mediators. Hence, **Dionysius** says, in *On the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy*: *the most sacred divine law is such that by first things the middle things should be led to his most divine light*. This law is found not only in spiritual things but also in bodily things. Hence **Augustine** says, in *On the Trinity*: *therefore, in the way that the most base and lowly are ruled by more subtle and powerful in rank, so also all bodies are ruled by the rational spirit of life*."

**Frequently Cited Authorities:**
- Scripture (especially Psalms, Wisdom literature, Pauline epistles, Job)
- Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite
- Augustine of Hippo
- Gregory the Great
- John Damascene
- The Glossa Ordinaria (standard biblical commentary)

### 5. Extended Allegory

The thema is not merely quoted but systematically allegorized. Each physical element corresponds to a spiritual reality.

**Principle:** Develop the metaphor with care and consistency. Every detail of the image should yield meaning.

**Allegory in Rigans Montes:**
| Physical Element | Spiritual Meaning |
|------------------|-------------------|
| The heights / upper rooms | Divine wisdom, God's nature |
| Rain / water | Sacred doctrine, teaching |
| Mountains | Teachers, doctors of the Church |
| Rivers flowing from mountains | Transmission of learning |
| The earth | Students, hearers |
| Fruit / satisfaction | Understanding, spiritual growth |

Thomas sustains this metaphor throughout, returning to the image to draw out new implications in each section.

---

### 6. Movement from Universal to Particular

Thomas begins with cosmic principles and descends to practical application.

**Principle:** Start with the highest cause (God's providence, eternal law) and move systematically downward to immediate circumstances (the duties of this teacher, these students, this university).

**Structure:**
1. Universal principle (God's eternal design)
2. General application (how this applies to sacred doctrine)
3. Specific application (what this means for teachers)
4. Immediate application (what this means for us, here, now)

---

### 7. Rhetorical Questions

Thomas employs questions to create moments of reflection and transition.

**Principle:** Use rhetorical questions to acknowledge difficulty, express humility, or pivot to a new consideration.

**Examples:**
> "But *for these things who is so sufficient?*" (2 Cor 2:16)

This question acknowledges the weight of the office being assumed and creates an opening for discussing divine assistance.

---

### 8. Parallelism and Balanced Phrasing

Thomas constructs sentences with careful parallel structure, especially when listing duties or qualities.

**Principle:** When enumerating requirements or qualities, use consistent grammatical structure. Each item should mirror the others in form.

**Example:**
> "Therefore, all teachers of Sacred Scripture should be:
> - lifted up by the eminence of their lives so that they may be fit to preach effectively...
> - illuminated so that they may teach well by reading...
> - armed so that they may refute errors by argument..."

**Pattern:** [Quality] + [Purpose clause with infinitive]

---

### 9. Tone: Humble, Reverent, Pedagogical

Thomas's voice is:
- **Humble** regarding his own capacities ("But although no one by himself, of himself, is sufficient for such a ministry...")
- **Reverent** toward divine wisdom and the tradition
- **Pedagogical** — always teaching, always clarifying
- **Serious** but not severe; earnest but not harsh
- **Impersonal** — he rarely speaks in the first person singular; when he does, it is to express inadequacy

**Principle:** Avoid self-aggrandizement. Present yourself as a minister, not an originator. The wisdom comes from above; you are merely a conduit.

---

### 10. The Concluding Prayer

The lecture ends with a brief prayer, returning to the source of all wisdom.

**Principle:** Close with a prayer that acknowledges dependence on God and invites the audience into shared petition.

**Example:**
> *Oremus. Nobis Christus concedat. Amen.*
> (*Let us pray. May Christ grant it to us. Amen.*)

The brevity is striking. After the elaborate intellectual structure, the conclusion is simple trust.

## Prescription: How to Compose a Thomistic Lecture

### Step 1: Select the Thema

Choose a Scripture passage that:
- Contains a vivid image or metaphor
- Can be divided into several elements for allegorical interpretation
- Relates to your subject matter

### Step 2: Announce Your Division

State explicitly how many points you will cover. Prefer three or four.

> "In these words we may consider three things: first... second... third..."

### Step 3: Develop Each Point

For each point:
1. State the claim
2. Support with Scripture (at least one citation)
3. Support with patristic authority (at least one Father)
4. Draw out the implication for your audience

### Step 4: Maintain the Allegory

Return to the central image repeatedly. Show how each new consideration is already contained in the thema.

### Step 5: Use Tripartite Subdivision

Within each major section, seek to identify three aspects or causes. This creates a sense of thoroughness without exhaustion.

### Step 6: Progress from Height to Depth

Move from:
- God's eternal design → general principle → specific application → present duty
- Or: cause → effect → sign
- Or: what it is → why it matters → what we must do

### Step 7: Employ Rhetorical Questions

Use questions to:
- Mark transitions
- Acknowledge difficulty
- Create moments of reflection
- Introduce objections (to be answered)

### Step 8: Maintain Parallel Structure

When listing duties, qualities, or conditions, ensure grammatical consistency across items.

### Step 9: Conclude Briefly

End with:
- A summary statement returning to the thema, or
- A brief exhortation, or
- A prayer

Do not introduce new material in the conclusion.

## Sample Sentence Patterns

**Opening a section:**
> "The [quality/dignity/condition] is shown in the words: *[Scripture quotation]*."

**Introducing evidence:**
> "Hence [Authority] says, in [Work]: *[quotation]*."

**Tripartite enumeration:**
> "This is so on account of three things: first... second... third..."

**Drawing application:**
> "Similarly, [group] should [quality], as it is written: *[Scripture]*."

**Transitional question:**
> "But *[Scripture quotation in question form]*?"

**Humble acknowledgment:**
> "But although no one by himself, of himself, is sufficient for such a [task], he can hope to receive [grace/sufficiency] from God."

## Vocabulary and Diction

Thomas's Latin is precise and technical. When writing in English in his style:

**Prefer:**
- "Sacred doctrine" over "theology"
- "Hearers" or "listeners" over "audience"
- "Ministry" over "job" or "role"
- "Sufficiency" over "enough"
- "Fruitful" over "productive"
- "Elevation" over "improvement"
- "Illumination" over "insight"

**Use imagery from:**
- Nature: mountains, waters, rain, earth, fruit, light, darkness
- Military: fortification, defense, armor, enemies
- Agriculture: sowing, reaping, watering, growth
- Architecture: heights, upper rooms, foundations

## A Note on Humility

Thomas was approximately 31 years old when he delivered this lecture — younger than the required age of 35 for a Master of Theology. According to Bernard Gui, Thomas received the thema in a dream after praying anxiously about what to say.

The lecture itself, for all its intellectual rigor, is fundamentally about dependence: on God, on tradition, on the ministry of others. The teacher is a mountain, yes — but only because he is watered from above. The fruit belongs not to the mountain but to the One who sends the rain.

This is the final principle: **the Thomistic lecturer does not present himself as a source, but as a conduit.**

> "Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God." (2 Cor 3:5)
