# Of the Strange Occurrence at the Council of Lyon, 1274
## Being an Account in the Manner of Matthew Paris

Of the disturbance caused by the smile of Brother Thomas.

About this time, when Brother Thomas had spoken thus far, a murmuring arose amongst those assembled, for a strange and unsettling thing had come to pass. Brother Thomas, that renowned doctor of the Church, that pillar of the Dominican order whom men called the Dumb Ox on account of his great bulk and his greater silence in youth, had begun to smile. And this smile was not as the smiles of other men. In twenty years of teaching, disputation, and ecclesiastical discourse, no man present---neither cardinal nor bishop nor the meanest clerk---had ever witnessed such an expression upon his countenance. It was, as many observed, too wide, and involved too many teeth for comfort.

Cardinal Bonaventure, a man of illustrious learning and renowned sanctity, who had long been a friend and rival to Thomas in the schools, would later write in his private letters that this smile put him in mind of nothing so much as a wound---as though the face of Thomas had been opened by some unseen blade, and what issued forth was not blood but something else entirely. Many were astonished at this, and whispered amongst themselves, though they knew not what to make of it.

"I was shown something," Thomas continued, his voice remaining gentle and warm as it had been, though now tinged with something that caused several of the assembled fathers to make the sign of the cross. "And I was told: BE NOT AFRAID."

At these words, spoken with such strange emphasis, a papal secretary---one Giacomo of Viterbo, a diligent man who had faithfully recorded the proceedings---noticed that Brother Thomas had begun to sway where he stood, almost imperceptibly, as though keeping time to some distant liturgy that no other ear could hear. This secretary, being a man of careful observation, noted this in the margin of his record, though he later struck through these words with such violence that the parchment was torn.

Of the words Brother Thomas spoke concerning the Greeks.

"The Greeks are not wrong, my brothers," Thomas proclaimed, and at this many gasped, for they had expected the great Angelic Doctor to demolish the Eastern position as he had demolished so many errors before. "Nor are we. We are both so much less than wrong that the word loses meaning. We have been disputing the procession of the Spirit as though we understood what 'procession' means. As though we understood what a 'Spirit' is. We have been very precise about the furniture of a house we have never entered."

Here Thomas stopped, and his eyes---those eyes which had read more books than any man living, which had penetrated the depths of Aristotle and the heights of Sacred Scripture---found something above the assembly. Or perhaps behind them. Or, as one witness would later attest with trembling hand, in a direction that the architecture of the cathedral did not contain. Wherefore it is to be wondered at that a man of such learning and sanctity should speak thus, as though all his great works had been mere preparation for this undoing.

"Forgive me," said Thomas, and reached into his robes to produce what appeared to be his well-known manuscript, that treatise entitled *Contra Errores Graecorum*, or "Against the Errors of the Greeks," which he had been summoned to present. Many leaned forward, expecting at last the arguments they had anticipated. But Thomas spoke again: "It is not the Father. It is not the Son. It is not the Spirit, *filioque* or otherwise. There have certainly been errors---" and here his voice began to trail away, as a candle gutters before it is extinguished, "---and I have made corrections."

Of what Brother Thomas read, and the ending of the records.

Then Brother Thomas began to read from his manuscript. But the words that issued from his mouth were not Latin, the tongue of the Church. Neither were they Greek, the tongue of the Eastern fathers. They were not any language that any man present had ever heard, though several who had travelled to the furthest reaches of Christendom and beyond---to the courts of the Tartars and the markets of the Saracens---swore they had never encountered their like.

Here the records of the Council of Lyon, in the year of our Lord 1274, come to an abrupt end. In later accounts of this event, which circulated privately amongst certain monasteries and were swiftly suppressed, several monks who had been present would insist that what Thomas spoke were not words at all. They were, these monks attested, older than words---that words had been built over them in the manner that cathedrals are built over catacombs, to contain what lies beneath and to prevent the faithful from stumbling upon what should not be disturbed.

Officially, it was given out that the final pages of the council records were lost to water damage. But this explanation satisfied few who knew the circumstances, for the weather at Lyon had been fair, and the scriptorium where the records were kept was renowned for its dryness. Many said that this account was not without its purpose, though what that purpose might be, wise men declined to speculate.

Of the changes that followed, and matters too strange for full relation.

In the years that followed this council---the full account of which this chronicler has been unable to obtain, though he has made diligent inquiry---certain alterations were made which astonished all who learned of them. The Dominican Order, those faithful Friars Preachers whose motto had always been *Veritas*, meaning "Truth," quietly changed their device in the year 1277 to *Nescire*, which is to say, "To Not Know." When asked the reason for this change, the masters of the order would say only that Brother Thomas, in his wisdom, had shown them a more excellent way.

More remarkable still, the *Summa Theologica*, that great unfinished cathedral of words which Thomas had laboured over for so many years, was placed upon the Index of Forbidden Books, where---if reports are to be believed---it remains to this day in that strange timeline of which we speak. This seemed to many a great injustice, that the works of so holy and learned a doctor should be suppressed; but those who had authority in these matters maintained a silence more eloquent than any argument.

Most wonderfully of all, the Eastern and Western churches, which had been divided for two hundred and twenty years over matters of the *filioque* and the procession of the Holy Spirit, were reunified within eighteen months of the council---not through any theological agreement, as had been hoped, but through what the sources of the Vatican describe only as "mutual defensive necessity." The nature of the threat which occasioned this necessity is not specified in any document that has come to light. The record-keepers who might have specified it are no longer record-keepers. They are no longer, it is whispered, anything that requires a title or an office amongst men.

What Thomas saw in that chapel in December, what he attempted to convey at Lyon, and what he read from his corrected manuscript---these things remain hidden, perhaps mercifully so. For as Thomas himself once wrote, before that December day when all his words became as straw: there are some things which, being seen, cannot be unseen; and there are doors which, once opened, permit no return. Whether Thomas opened such a door, or whether such a door opened Thomas, only God in His wisdom knows. And perhaps not even He speaks of it willingly.

*Thus far have we been able to discover concerning this matter. What more there may be to tell, we leave to those who have courage to seek it---though we counsel them, in charity, to consider well whether some knowledge is worth its price.*
