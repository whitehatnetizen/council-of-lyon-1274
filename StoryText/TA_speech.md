## Thema (Job 42:5-6)

**Auditu auris audivi te; nunc autem oculus meus videt te. Idcirco ipse me reprehendo, et ago poenitentiam in favilla et cinere.**

*I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes.*

## Preface

Brothers...

I come before you bearing a text I did not choose. When blessed Job had contended long with his comforters, when he had spoken much and defended himself with many words, the Lord answered him from the whirlwind. And Job, who had demanded justice, who had built arguments as a man builds walls, spoke these final words: *I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth thee.*

Pope Gregory summoned Thomas the theologian, Thomas the systematizer. That man set forth from Naples with his manuscripts and his arguments. But that man did not arrive.

Something befell him in a chapel in December, during the elevation of the Host. What stands before you now is what remains: dust and ashes, as Job says.

In this text we may consider three things:
- the insufficiency of hearing,
- the terror of sight,
- and the mercy of silence.

## Caput 1: De Insufficientia Auditus
### (On the Insufficiency of Hearing)

The insufficiency is shown in the words: *auditu auris audivi te*, that is, *by the hearing of the ear I have heard of thee*.

Job had heard much. He had received the testimony of his fathers. He had learned the traditions of the wise. And I, brothers: I have heard more than most. I have studied the Sentences of the Lombard and disputed them in the schools of Paris. I have written eight million words about the God I had heard of by the hearing of the ear.

This hearing has three deficiencies:

**First**, hearing comes through mediation. The image is not the thing. I have written of God's simplicity, His eternity, His omnipotence. I have been very precise. I have described the furniture of a house I had never entered.

**Second**, hearing admits of disputation. What is heard may be contested. And so we contest, we Latins, we Greeks, for two hundred and twenty years over the filioque. I have written on this question in my *Contra Errores Graecorum*. I have the pages here.

**Third**, hearing preserves the hearer. One may hear of fire without being burned. One may hear of the abyss without falling. This is the mercy of hearing, and also its poverty. I lived for fifty years in this mercy. I did not know it was mercy. I thought it was knowledge.

Hence Theodotus the Silent writes in his *Sayings*: *he who has only heard speaks boldly; he who has seen falls silent; but he who has been seen by what he sought to see, that one is no longer his own*.

I was bold, brothers. I was so very bold.

## Caput 2: De Terrore Visionis
### (On the Terror of Sight)

The terror is shown in the words: *nunc autem oculus meus videt te*, that is, *but now mine eye seeth thee*.

I must confess to you, and I use the word "brothers" now with more weight than I have ever used it: I no longer know what an "error" is when we speak of the Infinite. I have been shown that the God we debate is not a proposition to be correct about. He is not a territory to be mapped with Latin words or Greek words.

I cannot say what He is. I can only tell you that I was held in the palm of something, and I understood that all I have written was the babbling of an infant who believes he has explained his father.

Concerning this vision, three things must be said:

**First**, vision comes without mediation. As Dionysius writes in the *Mystical Theology*: the soul that ascends must leave behind all things, including its own concepts, until it enters the darkness where... where He dwells. I did not ascend, brothers. I was taken. And what I found in that darkness... what found me... had so very many eyes.

The prophet Ezekiel was shown the living creatures, and he writes: *their wheels were full of eyes all around*. I read this passage a hundred times. I wrote commentaries. I did not understand that he was warning us.

**Second**, vision does not admit of disputation. What is seen simply is. I look now at this schism, two hundred and twenty years of Christians refusing the Eucharist to Christians, and I am undone. The Greeks are not wrong, my brothers. Nor are we. We are both so much less than wrong that the word loses meaning.

**Third**, vision transforms the one who sees. Job, after seeing, despised himself, *me reprehendo*: he rejected himself, he melted away. I have melted, brothers. The Thomas who was summoned has melted. What stands before you is what refused to dissolve.

## Caput 3: De Misericordia Silentii
### (On the Mercy of Silence)

The mercy is shown in the words: *in favilla et cinere*, that is, *in dust and ashes*.

Job, having seen, did not write a treatise. He sat in the ashes and was silent. The *Summa Theologica* remains unfinished on my desk. It will remain unfinished. All that I have written seems like straw to me now: straw, fit only for burning.

What do I repent? Not my sins against the commandments. I repent my precision. I repent my confidence. I repent the years I spent being correct about mysteries that correctness cannot touch.

There is a wound in the Body of... in the Church. I called it a wound. I used to weep over it. I do not weep now. I see its purpose. I see that there are things that love us enough to let us remain divided, because this division is a protection. Unity, true unity, opens doors that perhaps should stay shut.

I have walked through such a door. I cannot walk back.

I have love for the Greeks. I have love for the monks on Athos who have touched the hem of what I have seen and called it *theosis*. They have come so close to understanding. We are all so beautiful in our not-knowing.

There are things I could tell you. But I have the deepest love for you. You cannot know how tender you all are to me now. How precious. All of you, with your arguments and your certainties.

I would give every book I have written to un-see, to un-know.

I am sorry that I have begun to know.

Concerning silence, two things remain...

*[Here Brother Thomas paused. His eyes found something above the assembly, or behind them, or perhaps in a direction the architecture did not contain.]*

## Epilogus

Forgive me.

I was sent to read to you from my treatise against the errors of the Greeks.

*[He produced the manuscript of Contra Errores Graecorum from his robes.]*

It is not the Father. It is not the Son. It is not the Spirit.

There have certainly been errors.

...

And I have made corrections.

...

I know what you expect of me. You expect the Dumb Ox to crush the Eastern position beneath the weight of Aristotelian categories. There are men in this room who have waited years for this.

...

Wheels. Yes.

I have no arguments left in me. I have only...

I have been shown something. And I was told *BE NOT AFRAID*.

Wheels within wheels.

We have broken something holy. Something words cannot mend.

So very many eyes.

Let us pray.

*[Brother Thomas began to read from his manuscript. The words were not Latin. They were not Greek. Several monks would later insist they were not words at all, that they were older than words, that words had been built over them the way cathedrals are built over catacombs.]*

*Officially, the final pages were lost to water damage.*
