## A Brief Account of the Events at the Address of Brother Thomas of Aquino

### At the Council of Lyon, in the Year of Our Lord 1274

---

**(1)** In the session appointed for the reading of the treatise *Contra Errores Graecorum*, Brother Thomas of Aquino, of the Order of Preachers, who had been summoned by the lord Pope Gregory to address the council on the matter of the Greek schism, rose to speak. He had been called as a doctor of great renown, whose writings on this question were known throughout Christendom.

**(2)** Quibus peractis, Brother Thomas began not with the expected arguments but with a confession, stating that he came before the assembly not as the man who had been summoned. He declared that something had occurred to him in a chapel in December, during the elevation of the Host, and that what stood before them was what remained. He stated that he had been sent to read from his treatise against the errors of the Greeks, and that he had the pages with him, and could recite them from memory, but that he no longer knew what an "error" was when speaking of the Infinite. He asserted that the God whom they debated was not a proposition to be correct about, and that his eight million words had been the babbling of an infant.

**(3)** Item, he spoke of the schism, which had endured two hundred and twenty years, and stated that he was undone by it. He declared that they had permitted children to grow and die, generation after generation, being taught that their brothers across the sea were enemies of God. He asked for what cause this had occurred—for the *filioque*, for whether the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone or from the Father and the Son. He stated that he had written precisely on this question, and had been very clear and very rigorous and very correct. He then stated that he saw the purpose of the division now, and that there were things that loved them enough to let them remain divided, because the division was a protection, and that unity opened doors that perhaps should remain shut. He stated that he had walked through such a door and could not walk back.

**(4)** Postmodum, he stated that he knew what they expected of him—that the one called the Dumb Ox should crush the Eastern position beneath the weight of Aristotelian categories—but that he had no arguments remaining in him. He declared that he had only the deepest love for them, and for the Greeks, and for the farmers in Calabria, and for the monks on Athos, whom he said had come close to understanding. He spoke of the prophets Ezekiel and of the Revelation, and of what remains when doctrine burns away.

**(5)** Tunc, Brother Thomas smiled. It was observed by many present that no one in twenty years of teaching and disputation had seen him smile in such a manner. It was too wide and involved too many teeth. Cardinal Bonaventure, who was present, would later write that it reminded him of a wound. Brother Thomas continued speaking, his voice remaining gentle, and stated that he had been shown something, and had been told the words "BE NOT AFRAID."

**(6)** A secretary of the lord Pope observed that Brother Thomas had begun swaying slightly, as though keeping time to some distant liturgy. Brother Thomas then stated that the Greeks were not wrong, nor were they of the West, and that both were so much less than wrong that the word lost its meaning. He stated that they had been disputing the procession of the Spirit as though they understood what "procession" meant, or what a "Spirit" was, and that they had been very precise about the furniture of a house they had never entered.

**(7)** Quibus dictis, Brother Thomas stopped. His eyes found something above the assembly, or behind them, or—as several witnesses attested—in a direction that the architecture of the cathedral did not contain. He then asked forgiveness and produced from his robes what appeared to be his manuscript, the treatise *Contra Errores Graecorum*. He stated that it was not the Father, and not the Son, and not the Spirit, *filioque* or otherwise. He stated that there had certainly been errors, and that he had made corrections.

**(8)** He then began to read from his manuscript. The words were not Latin. They were not Greek.

**(9)** In later accounts of these proceedings, several monks who had been present would attest that what Brother Thomas spoke were not words, but were older than words, and that words had been built over them in the manner that cathedrals are built over catacombs.

Officially, it was recorded that the final pages of the council acts were lost to water damage.

Et sic illius diei fuit sessio terminata.

### Addendum

**(10)** It is recorded that in the year 1277, the motto of the Order of Preachers was changed from *Veritas* to *Nescire*. Item, the treatise called *Summa Theologica*, composed by Brother Thomas, was placed upon the Index of Forbidden Books, where it is stated to remain.

**(11)** Item, it is recorded that the Eastern and Western churches were reunified within eighteen months of this council—not through theological agreement, but through what the sources of the lord Pope describe only as "mutual defensive necessity." The nature of that necessity is not specified in the documents that have been preserved. Those who kept the records and who might have specified it are no longer record-keepers. They are no longer anything that requires designation by office or title.
